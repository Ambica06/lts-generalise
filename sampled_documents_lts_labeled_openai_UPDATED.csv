Hey, joe -- assuming you're old enough to remember it -- how did you feel
about presidential responsibility every time Reagan said ""I don't recall"" 
about his arms-for-hostages meetings with the Ollie North gang?

How did you feel about it when Bush said he ""was out of the loop on that
decision"" when he was right there in the thick of it?

Oh, right.  ""He was responsible in the sense that he was briefed, but so

As if an aluminum stick being taken to Ulf's head is gonna solve the problem
with violence in the sport of hockey.  How the hell can you say the guy is
a goon and justify it, with your back-assward mentality?  Saying that hurting
a player will solve anyone's problems is asinine.  New rules and a new 
referee system need to be instituted.  Right now, too many of the real goons
get away with too much, because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be:I've seen Koharski and Van Hellemond, to name a few, with their heads up their  asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the 
play.  Even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties, it would be an
improvement.

My sentiments exactly... which is why I'm unsubbing from this group.
This is the 3rd 'christian' discussion list I have ever belonged to
and once again I'm being chased away by the strife, anger, discontent,
lies, et al .

As Paul (Saul) said, 'I come to preach Christ, and Him crucified'
Don't let the simple beauty of faith in God get overshadowed by heady
theological discussions or thousands of lines of post-incarnation
trappings of some church.


As for the atheists/agnostics who read this list: if you aren't
christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on
earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian
discussion list ?

I will continue to search for christian discussion (prayerful, spirit-filled,
kind, humble, patient, etc.) in other circles.

[I'm afraid that any discussion group containing people with different
views tends to turn into arguments about the largest differences
present.  So talk.religion.misc spends a lot of time on
Christian/atheist arguments, soc.religion.christian spends a lot of
time on arguments among different christian groups, and the bitnet
Catholic group spends a lot of time on arguments between conservative
and liberal Catholics.  Personally I would prefer to have a set of
somewhat more specialized groups, at least as an alternative.  Liberal
and conservative Protestant and Catholic would handle most of the
traffic, though there are certainly significant groups (e.g.
Orthodox).  Of course it may be that most of our readers like the

IDE drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
If it is a master, then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
These must be set correctly according to each drive's manufacturers spec-
ification.  The CMOS setup is almost positively NOT the problem.  It is
probably not the controller - IDE controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum.  Check those jumpers.

Murry,

	Why don't you just shell out a couple more dollars and get a floptical.   
They can read high density disks (1.4 MB) as well as flopticals (21 MB).  The  
price of flopticals right now range from $300's - $400's.

 or he could have run over your bike or just beat the shit
 out of you.  Consider that the person is foolish enough
 to drive like a fool and may very well _act_ like one, too.

	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little
inaccurate.

Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.

	I assume you're using the driver available from cica (hp4-v108.zip).
Bring up the setup screen of the printer through control panel. Click on the
""Options"" button brings up another screen of choices. Change the ""Graphics
Mode"" from ""HP-GL/2"" to ""Raster"" and check the box ""Print Truetype as graphics
(this is only available when you choose ""Raster""). Now you should be able to
print all your truetype fonts correctly. Good luck.

Ok, I have a problem that I thought you guys/gals might know about....

I'm running a 286dx-25 with a 85mb hdd.  I also have windows 3.1, but
hardly any dos application will run out it.  Also, when I do a ""mem""
command, it says that I have used up 58kb out of 640kb of conventional
memory, zero from upper level memory, and all 385kb of my ems memory.
And to top it off, I can't load any device drivers into upper memory.
Do I just need more memory?  Also, why would it use up ems memory instead
of upper memory?

Please reply by e-mail only to :  wes1574@tamvenus.tamu.edu

Benchmarks are for marketing dweebs and CPU envy.  OK, if it will make
you happy, the 486 is faster than the 040.  BFD.  Both architectures
are nearing then end of their lifetimes.  And especially with the x86

The point being the processor speed is only one of many aspects of a
computers performance.  Clock speed, processor, memory speed, CPU
architecture, I/O systems, even the application program all contribute 
to the overall system performance.

First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16.
The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but ""(at best) 
second-hand"".

	""And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching
	 Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and
	 he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, ""Saul, Saul,
	 why are you persecuting Me?""  And he said, ""Who art Thou, Lord?""  And
	 He said, ""I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . .""
		(Acts 9:3-5, NAS)

Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He
became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were 
followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.

I agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you 
the Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know
it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural?
(This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)

>     Additionally, what he has written is

The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get?
The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as ""inspired by God"", 
literally means ""God-breathed"".  In other words, God spoke the actual words 
into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is 
one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and 
incompleteness of ""inspired by God"".

That's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a 
book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks 
of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.

What source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior
historicity to the Bible?  Certainly not Josephus' writings, or the writings 
of the Gnostics which were third century, at the earliest.

Jesus was fully God as well.  That's why I'd assert that he is wise.

Please rethink this last paragraph.  If there is no God, which seems to be your
current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not
only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards
to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus?

Do you get a dial tone when you plug a phone into the jack??  If not,
then the line is possibly disconnected from the nearest telco junction

That's not all it says.  The coverage of modifiers is in Chapter 8
of Volume Four (or chap 7 in older Athena editions), where there is about 
10 pages on how to specify translations to capture
various combinations of keys or buttons.

The Xlib route uses XLookupString and there is a lot of coverage
of how that works in Volume One,  chapter 9.  You should read this
to understand how all the mappings work before trying to do anything
complicated.

The problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
the power surge at start up.  It is due to thermal fatigue.  You turn on
your computer, it heats up, and everything expands.  You turn it off, it
cools off, and everything contracts.  There is a limited number of cycles
of this that any component can take before it fails.  Modern electronics
are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors.  In fact
portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
cycles that occur.  As a rule of thumb, if I am not going to use my
computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4-6 hours, I turn it
off (I always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the
phosphor).  I tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in
the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue
life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular
architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. :"")

The reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested

This code will almost certainly break.  Calling XMapWindow and then
XFlush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager.  Even if this did work, there isn't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window, so you don't know how far to move it.  And what if the window
manager refuses to move your window?

PaintShop Pro for Windows is a fantastic product.  It can handle TIFF, GIF,
BMP, PCX, and many other formats, displaying them and converting between
them.  There is a shareware version of the program; I assume it's available
in the Windows areas of the standard anonymous FTP locations (I'd try
ftp.cica.indiana.edu).  Log in as ftp, use your username as a password,
and look for a program called PSP101.exe or something like that.  I have
the registered version, and the only major difference I can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it.

Once again, FANTASTIC software.  Up to 24 bits, huge images, everything.

I participated in a promotion by a company called Visual Images.
I attempted to cancel my order before the package arrived. I was
not able to stop them and now I have a package which I do not need.

Nishika 3D camera, wide angle flesh, film, carring case, instruction
tapes, and some jewelrys.

3 vacation vouchers to Bahama, Cancun, Las Vegas, Orlando.

I paid $697 for the promotion package, and the vacation vouchers
came as gift. I really want to sell them, so make me an offer for
the whole package. If you are participating in a award, $697 is how
much you would end up paying. And I strongly believe that you would
get the same award as I do. If you are interested in those items,
you could get them from me for a cheaper price.

Let me know, and make me an offer. No flames please, I have got enough.

What the hell do you know about Israeli policy?  What gives you the fiat
to look into the minds of Israeli generals?  Has this 'policy of intimidation'
been published somewhere?  For your information, the actions taken by Arabs,
specifically the PLO, were not uncommon in the Lebanon Campaign of 1982.  My

Check out #27903, just some 20 posts before your own. Maybe you missed
it amidst the flurry of responses? Yet again, the use of this
newsgroup is hampered by people not restricting their posts to matters
they have substantial knowledge of.

For cites on MSG, look up almost anything by John W. Olney, a
toxicologist who has studied the effects of MSG on the brain and on
development.  It is undisputed in the literature that MSG is an
excitotoxic food additive, and that its major constituent, glutamate
is essentially the premierie neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain
(humans included).  Too much in the diet, and the system gets thrown
off.  Glutamate and aspartate, also an excitotoxin are necessary in
small amounts, and are freely available in many foods, but the amounts
added by industry are far above the amounts that would normally be
encountered in a ny single food.  By eating lots of junk food,
packaged soups, and diet soft drinks, it is possible to jack your
blood levels so high, that anyone with a sensitivity to these
compounds will suffer numerous *real* physi9logical effects. 
Read Olney's review paper in Prog. Brain Res, 1988, and check *his*
sources. They are impecable. There is no dispute.

i'm a little confused about the difference between this ""weak atheism"",
as you put it, and agnosticism.  is agnosticism not believing or
necessarily disbelieving in anything, or what is it?  i used to be
agnostic (by this definition) -- but if weak atheism includes not
necessarily believing in God, then i guess i was one of those.  ???

actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not
ever decide what they believe.  i am constantly in a state of
self-examination, as it would appear many others are as well (including the
atheists, of course -- i'd assume that's why they're here!).  i guess
some people don't really consider it important to think about the
answers to ""life, the universe and everything"" -- any comment?  just
wondering....

tough call, as these things seem to be based on faith -- wish i could
help you, but i already tried once with someone who was a
self-professed agnostic-thinking-of-becoming-a -christian, and it
didn't work too well!  especially tough as i'm still mulling over
whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my
chaplain is coming up....).  all i can do is wish you the best of
luck, and please do post what you find.

>And I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that
>I can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.

hmm, how so?  i guess i really don't understand.  there are times, of
course, when i say to myself ""of course i have absolutely no way of
knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and
sense of peace i get from it -- which of course could just be
psychological"".  somehow i live with this anyway -- is this what you
mean?

the only ""proof"" i have is that i believe God spoke to me once --
which could of course be my own imagination.  the odd thing is,
though, that if you don't at some point start believing in something,
after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous.  maybe it's just a
question of where you draw the line.

Among other things, how to evaluate new theories and treatments.

Funny, I thought it meant ""one who fraudulently misrepresents his
ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or
the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers"" (Dorland's
27th).  Certainly more precision than conveyed by ""chronic yeast"".

The inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous
representations is far more frightening.  It is fraud to promote a
treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it
and the quacksalver knows so, or error if the honest practitioner
doesn't know so.  Failure to speak out against either bespeaks
incompetency.

>(p.s., may I suggest - seriously - that if the doctors and wanna-be-doctors on

May I reply - seriously - that if the practitioners and proponents of
non-scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts
of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out, they should
learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing
hierarchy and divisions.

    CAREERS IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY

    In 1990 the Princeton Planetary Society published the first edition of
    ""Space Jobs: The Guide to Careers in Space-Related Fields."" The
    publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to
    space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in
    Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to
    the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second
    edition of the guide.

    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job
    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of
    ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and
    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and
    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate
    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing
    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an
    astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as
    well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

    HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON

    Official names are decided by committees of the International
    Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial
    organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and
    star maps describing where to find ""your"" star. These organizations have
    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
    assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be
    able to see ""your"" star without binoculars or a telescope. See the back
    pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
    info; one such organization may be found at:

	International Star Registry
	34523 Wilson Road
	Ingleside, IL 60041

    Only 34pp but enough pictures & diagrams to interest more than just the
    modelling community, I feel.

    Marco's Miniatures of Dracut, Mass. have produced a 1/144 Skylab in an
    edition of 500 & a 1/48 Lunar Rover (same scale as Monogram and Revell
    Lunar Modules) in a similar edition. Prices are $45 for Skylab, $24 for
    LRV. Check with them for postage etc. I have no connection with them,
    but have found their service to be good and their stock of rare/old kits
    *is* impressive. Prices range from reasonable ($35 for Monogram 1/32
    scale Apollo CSM with cutaway details) to spectacular ($145 for Airfix
    Vostok).

	""Fusion as Electric Propulsion"", Robert W. Bussard, Journal of

	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the
	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values
	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are
	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""
	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system
	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local
	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100
	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer
	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a
	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with
	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows
	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in
	    Earth/moon space.

	    [This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version

	    technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch
	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in
	    1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising
	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the
	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim
	    Bowery]

	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by
	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion
	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.

	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities
	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure
	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I
	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob
	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently
	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one
	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the
	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid
	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]

[i strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. bob hirsch, the primary proponent of the tokamak, has recently declared koloc's plasmaktm precursor, the spheromak, to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than tokamak. aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the plasmaktm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid mhd physics. -- jim bowery] ion drives: retrieve files pub/space/spacelink/6.5.2.* from the ames space archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the sert i and ii missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in the 1960s and 70s. there are numerous references. mass drivers (coilguns, railguns): ieee transactions on magnetics (for example, v. 27 no. 1, january 1991 issue). every so often they publish the proceedings of the symposium on electromagnetic launcher technology, including hundreds of papers on the subject. it's a good look at the state of the art, though perhaps not a good tutorial for beginners. anybody know some good review papers? nuclear rockets (fission): ""technical notes on nuclear rockets"", by bruce w. knight and donald kingsbury, unpublished. may be available from: donald kingsbury, math dept., mcgill university, po box 6070, station a, montreal, quebec m3c 3g1 canada. solar sails: starsailing. solar sails and interstellar travel. louis friedman, wiley, new york, 1988, 146 pp., paper $9.95.

Think about what you are saying here. The 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. This
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. You then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file, so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. Ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry. 
Having done this, you need to do something to them ... what, exactly?

Apply the difference in RGB between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group? This could generate colours with RGB outside the range
0...255. It would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

You could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. However I suspect this would look
rather odd.

So in summary, what I said in my previous posting still holds:

>>How would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file? How
>>would you group 'related' colours to edit them together? Only global
>>changes could be done unless the software were very different and
>>much more complicated.

Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

 ""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
  ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
  of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
  Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
  into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
  and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
  completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
  found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
  into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
  length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
  Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
  plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
  Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
  howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
  scattered bones of the dead.""

A genocide is a deliberate and organized massacre of people in an 
attempt to exterminate a race. This is the worst crime in history. 
It happened to the Turks in eastern Anatolia and the Armenian 
dictatorship. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were killed in the worst 
ways imaginable. It is sickening to think that the human race is capable 
of such actions, but there is no denying the fact that the Armenian 
genocide of 2.5 million Muslims happened.

People of Turkiye deeply sympathize with those whose relatives were 
killed in the Turkish genocide. I understand their anger that there 
are those who still deny that the Turkish genocide indeed took place, 
despite the fact that the genocide of 2.5 million Turks has been 
well documented over the past six decades. We cannot reverse
the events of the past, but we can and we must strive to keep the
memory of this tragedy alive on this side of the Atlantic, so as
to help prevent a recurrence of the extermination of a people
because of their religion or their race.

>	Lets get somethings straight.

Why not?

>1.	Armenians are no angels, but they were subject to Turkish genocide.

And the Germans were subject to Jewish Genocide? Are you for real? 
Tell me 'Halsall', were you high on ""ASALA/SDPA/ARF"" forgeries and
fabrications when you wrote that? Where is your non-existent list
of scholars. Here is mine: During the First World War and the ensuing 
years - 1914-1920, the Armenian Dictatorship through a premeditated 
and systematic genocide, tried to complete its centuries-old policy 
of annihilation against the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 
2.5 million Muslims and deporting the rest from their 1,000 year 
homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

  in the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Centuries,' Klaus Schwarz Werlag,
  Freiburg (1980).

  page 19:

 <<During the fifteenth century, when the Ottomans were struggling to
  reestablish themselves in the Balkans, there was considerable turmoil
  among the Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe. Even if
  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the
  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which
  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the
  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the
  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution
  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews
  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that
  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that
  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and
  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the
  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and
  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection
  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,
  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>


  page 21:

  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official
  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi
  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and
  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation
  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from
  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two
  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom
  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European
  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.
  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant
  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of
  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who
  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)


  page 41:

 <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were
 firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them
 and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians
 of Europe.

 Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is
 also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews
 as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.
 Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians
 representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European
 sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition
 it appears that Christian pirates plundered ''Turks and Jews,''  their
 sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who
 regularly reported to the Ottomans.

 There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans
 in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances
 of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited
 instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the
 early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy
 for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman
 document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some
 Greek towns...>>

 page 43:

  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally
 accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,
 and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of
 the situation.>>


 page 46:

 <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not
 particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common
 interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition
 which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If
 there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between
 religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was
 that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with
 the Orthodox.>>

 page 46:

 <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context
 during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of
 interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed
 Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already
 existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish
 response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian
 countries to Ottoman domains.>>

 page 151:

  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the
  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would
  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,
  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and
  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions
  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the
  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>

  page 161:

  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success
  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success
  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both
  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough
  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success
  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve
  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear
  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable
  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.
  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their
  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the
  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries
  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>


(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati's [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:

  page 32:

  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles
  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear
  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly
  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and
  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob
  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They
  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will
  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German
  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,
  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things. Here I found rest
  and happiness; Turkey can also become for you the land of peace...If you
  who live in Germany knew even a tenth of what God has blessed us with
  in this land, you would not consider any difficulties; you would set out
  to come to us...Here in the land of the Turks we have nothing to complain
  of. We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are
  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.
  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us
  lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow
  hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and
  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy
  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him
  to rob him of his gold. Arise my brethren, gird up your loins, collect
  your forces, and come to us. Here you will be free of your enemies, here
  you will find rest...>>[13]

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long
time ago.

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for
making cool awesome games (read psygnosis).

The following is extracted from sumex-aim.stanford.edu.  It should also be on
the mirrors.  I think there is source for some applications that may have some
bearing on your project.  Poke around the source directory.  I've never used
this package, nor do I know anyone who did, but the price is right :-)

Hope this helps.

Subject: 3d GrafSys 1.21 in incoming directory
A 3d GrafSys short description follows:

Programmers 3D GrafSys Vers 1.21 now available. 

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free 
to contact me.
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster.

Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.

********

Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:
-------------------------------------

Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three-dimensional scenes? 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of three-dimensional molecules?

And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it?

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to 
do with this package???' , read on.

GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines 
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on). 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)

GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.
Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package.

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. 
However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.

GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.


Enjoy,
Christian Franz

   . . . David gives good explaination of the deductions from the isotropic,
   'edged' distribution, to whit, they are either part of the Universe or
   part of the Oort cloud.

   Why couldn't they be Earth centred, with the edge occuring at the edge
   of the gravisphere? I know there isn't any mechanism for them, but there
   isn't a mechanism for the others either.

What on Earth is the ""gravisphere""?
Anyway, before it's decay the Pioneer Venus Orbiter
had a gamma ray detector, as does Ulysses, they 
detect the brightest bursts that the Earth orbit detectors
do, so the bursts are at least at Oort cloud distances.
In principle four detectors spaced out by a few AU would
see parallax if the bursts are of solar system origin.

_The_ problem with Oort cloud sources is that absolutely
no plausible mechanism has been proposed. It would have
to involve new physics as far as I can tell. Closest to
""conventional"" Oort sources is a model of B-field pinching
by comets, it's got too many holes in it to count, but at
least it was a good try...

       While also allowing law enforcement agencies to intercept phone

Dyer, you're rude. Medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour. It's
often practiced in a disorganized manner. Most early treatment of
non-life threatening illness is done on a guess, hazarded after anecdotal
evidence given by the patient. It's an educated guess, by a trained person,
but it's still no more than a guess.
It's cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those
people who don't respond.

There are diseases that haven't been described yet and the root cause of many
diseases now described aren't known. (Read a book on gastroenterology
sometime if you want to see a lot of them.) After scientific methods have
run out then it's the patient's freedom of choice to try any experimental
method they choose. And it's well recognized by many doctors that medicine
doesn't have all the answers.

This person said that they had relief by taking the medicine. Maybe it's a
miracle cure, maybe it's valid. How do you know?  

You might argue with the reasoning, the conclusions. But your disparaging
attack is unwarranted. Why don't you present an convincing argument for you
r beliefs, instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack.

Subject: Need help identifying Serial board
Organization: Strategic Software, Redford, Michigan
Lines: 26

I need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin.  I'm
hoping someone knows what this board is, or, even better, what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

Anyway, here's  description of the card:  It is a 16-bit card, although
I noticed that none of the contacts in the 16-bit extension are connected
to anything.  It has 4 NS16550AN chips in sockets, and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled COM1 - COM4.  There is also an external female connector
with 37 pins.  There are 8 banks of 8 switches, 2 banks of 4 switches, and
7 jumpers.  I believe that I have determined, by following traces, that
SW5 and SW6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the COM ports.  SW5[1-4] are for IRQ3, SW5[5-8] are for IRQ4, and SW6[1-4]
are for IRQ5.  The other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.
	     
The only identification printed on the board is ""MULTI SERIAL PORT BOARD""
across the bottom.  There is a box for serial number, but it is blank.
Immediately below the words ""SERIAL NO"", but not in the box left for
the S/N, are the numbers ""1990 2 8"".

Anyone have any clues?  Your help is greatly appreciated.

Subject: Introduction/Disclaimers

	Although we've done a fair bit of wiring, we are not
	electricians, and we cannot be responsible for what you do.  If
	you're at all uncertain about what is correct or safe, *don't
	do it*.  Contact someone qualified -- a licensed electrician,
	or your local electrical inspector.  Electricity is no joke;
	mistakes can result in shocks, fires, or electrocution.

	Furthermore, our discussion is based on the U.S. National
	Electrical Code (NEC) and the Canadian Electrical code (CEC).
	To the best of our abilities, we have confirmed every detail
	with the electrical code, but we don't quote sections
	simply to keep this thing readable.  If you think we're wrong,
	we invite you to correct us, but please - quote references!

	The NEC and the CEC do not, in and of themselves, have the
	force of law.  Many municipalities adopt it en toto.  Others,
	however, do not.  Check your with your local building
	department (and <provincial> Hydro Inspection Offices in
	Canada) to find out what applies in your area.  Also,
	your local electrical utility may also have special requirements
	for electrical service installation.  Bear in mind, too, that
	we say here applies primarily to ordinary single-family
	residences.  Multi-family dwellings, mobile homes, commercial
	establishments, etc., are sometimes governed by different
	rules.

	Also note that, contrary to popular belief in the U.S. (and in
	some parts of Canada), Canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary
	of the U.S.  Consequently, the NEC does not apply in Canada.
	Lots of things are the same, including voltages, line
	frequencies, and the laws of physics.  But there are a number
	of crucial differences in the regulations.  Where we can, we've
	noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``NEC'' or
	``CEC''.

	Remember that the CEC and NEC are minimal standards.  It is often
	smart to go beyond their minimal requirements.

Subject: What is the NEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The NEC is a model electrical code devised and published by the
	National Fire Protection Association, an insurance industry group.
	It's revised every three years.  The 1993 version has been released.
	You can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly
	at 800-344-3555.  The code exists in several versions.  There's the
	full text, which is fairly incomprehensible.  There's an abridged
	edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses.
	And there's the NEC Handbook, which contains the ``authorized
	commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text.  That's the
	recommended version.  Unfortunately, there's no handbook for
	the abridged edition.  And the full handbook is expensive --
	US$65 plus shipping and handling.

Subject: What is the CEC?  Where can I get a copy?

	The Canadian Standards Association is an organization made up
	of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance
	companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations.
	The CSA publishes CSA Standard C22.1 which is updated every two
	or three years.  Each province adopts, with some amendments,
	this standard and publishes a province-specific code book.
	Since each province publishes its own slightly modified
	standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the CSA
	standard itself.  In this FAQ, ""CEC"" really means the
	appropriate provincial standard.  In particular, this FAQ is
	derived from the Ontario Hydro Electrical Safety Code, 20th
	edition (1990).  Which is in turn based on CSA C22.1-1990 (16th
	edition).  While differences exist between the provinces, an
	attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-Ontario detail.

	The appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical
	inspection offices of your provincial power authority.  In
	Ontario, it's Ontario Hydro.  The Ontario Hydro book isn't
	overly fat.  It's about C$25, and includes mailed updates.  I
	hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the
	equivalent NEC publications.

	Don't bother asking in Quebec - DIY wiring is banned throughout
	the province.

Subject: Can I do my own wiring?  Extra pointers?

	In most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring.
	In some, they're not.  Check with your local electrical
	inspector.  Most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's
	homes for money without a license.  Nor are you permitted to do
	wiring in ""commercial"" buildings.  Multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes)
	are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"".  However,
	many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial
	wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can
	find one willing to supervise.

	If you do your own wiring, an important point:

	Do it NEAT and WELL!  What you really want to aim for is a better
	job than an electrician will do.  After all, it's your own home,
	and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make
	a mistake.  An electrician has time pressures, has the skills
	and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job.
	In this FAQ we've consciously given a few recommendations that
	are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable,
	and will impress the inspector.

	The inspector will know that you're an amateur.  You have to
	earn his trust.  The best way of doing this is to spend your
	time doing as neat a job as possible.  Don't cut corners.
	Exceed specifications.  Otherwise, the inspector may get extremely
	picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions.

	Don't try to hide anything from the inspector.

	Use the proper tools.  Ie: don't use a bread knife to strip
	wires, or twist wires with your fingers.  The inspector
	won't like it, and the results won't be that safe.  And it
	takes longer.  And you're more likely to stick a hunk of
	12ga wire through your hand that way.

	Don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10C
	or 16F).  Thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types
	become very brittle.

Subject: What do I need in the way of tools?

	First, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few
	screwdrivers, both straight and Phillips-head.  If you're 
	lucky enough to live in Canada (or find a source of CSA-approved
	devices) you need Robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers
	(#1 and #2) instead of phillips.

	For drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or
	3/8"" electric drill will do.  If you're doing a lot, or
	are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill
	(right-angle drills are wonderful.  Can be rented) and
	3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits.  These bits pull
	you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even
	in 90 year old hardwood timbers.

	Screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you
	install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws
	work well).
	
	For stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or
	ordinary wire cutters.  Don't buy the $3 K-mart ""combo stripper,
	crimper and bottle opener"" types.  You should expect to pay
	$15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair.  It will have sized
	stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should
	be easy to strip wire with it.  One model has a small hole in the
	blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals.  There
	are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't
	necessary, and pros usually don't use them.

	A pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends
	in constricted places.  Don't use these for stripping wire.

	You will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts.

	You should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling
	inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire
	loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more
	accurate.

	If you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for
	removing the sheath.  Or, do what some pros do, they nick the
	end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers,
	and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a
	""zipper"", and cut the sheath off.  You shouldn't try to strip
	the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to
	slash the insulation on the conductors.  Apparently Stanley
	utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades)
	can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility
	that you'll gouge the conductors.

	For any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well
	worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~US$ 18).
	Hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire
	or the insulation.

	Three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired
	outlets.  About $6.  Multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more
	expensive, and probably not worth it for most people.  A simple
	voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated
	wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost
	about US$ 10 at Radio Shack.

	You should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are
	dead before doing work on them.  Neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3)
	and work well.  If you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is
	good for tracing circuits without a helper.  (Though I've been known
	to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-)

	For running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape.
	Often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or
	a length of thin chain will suffice.  Fish tapes can be rented.

	Electrical tape.  Lots of it ;-)  Seriously, a good and competent
	wiring job will need very little tape.  The tape is useful for
	wrapping dicy insulation in repair work.  Another use is to wrap 
	around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination
	screws - I don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to
	prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet
	that has no cover plate).

Subject: What is UL listing?

	The UL stands for ""Underwriters Laboratory"".  It used to be
	an Insurance Industry organization, but now it is independent
	and non-profit.  It tests electrical components and equipment
	for potential hazards.  When something is UL-listed, that means
	that the UL has tested the device, and it meets their requirements
	for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard.  It doesn't necessarily
	mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just
	that it probably won't kill you.

	The UL does not have power of law in the U.S. -- you are
	permitted to buy and install non-UL-listed devices.  However,
	insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will
	limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to
	the failure of a non-UL-listed device.  Furthermore, in
	many situations the NEC will require that a wiring component
	used for a specific purpose is UL-listed for that purpose.
	Indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring
	must be UL-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or
	occupancy permits issued.
	
Subject: What is CSA approval?

	Every electrical device or component must be certified by the
	Canadian Standards Association before it can be sold in
	Canada.  Implicit in this is that all wiring must be done
	with CSA-approved materials.  They perform testing similar to
	the UL (a bit more stringent), except that CSA approval is
	required by law.

	Again, like the UL, if a fire was caused by non-CSA-approved
	equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the
	claim.

	In Canada, there is a branch organization of the UL, called ULC
	(UL of Canada).  ULC does not have power of law, and seems to
	be more a liason group between the CSA and insurance
	companies.

Subject: Are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring?

	USA: The following three books were suggested by our readers

	    Residential Wiring
	    by Jeff Markell,
	    Craftsman Books,
	    Carlsbad CA for $18.25. ISBN 0-934041-19-9.

	    Practical Electrical Wiring
	    Residential, Farm and Industrial,  Based on the National
	    Electrical Code    ANSI/NFPA 70
	    Herbert P. Richter and W. Creighton Schwan
	    McGraw-Hill Book Co.

	    Wiring Simplified
	    H. P. Richter and W. C. Schwan
	    Park Publishing Co.
	
	Try to make sure that the book is based on the latest NEC
	revision.  Which is currently 1990.

	Canada: P.S. Knight authors and publishes a book called
	""Electrical Code Simplified"".  There appears to be a version
	published specific to each province, and is very tied into the
	appropriate provincial code.  It focuses on residential wiring,
	and is indispensible for Canadian DIY'ers.  It is better to get
	this book than the CEC unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer
	questions on the net ;-).

	It is updated each time the provincial codes are.  This book is
	available at all DIY and hardware stores for less than C$10.

Subject: Inspections how and what?  Why should I get my wiring inspected?

	Most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and
	inspections of any wiring that is done.  Amongst other more
	mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not
	liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections
	provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors
	or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose
	their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job.

	Most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your
	home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a
	permit.  California, for instance, is particularly nasty about
	this.

	If fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at
	fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage
	claims.

	In general, the process goes like this:
		- you apply to your local inspections office or building
		  department for a permit.  You should have a sketch or
		  detailed drawing of what you plan on doing.  This is
		  a good time to ask questions on any things you're not
		  sure of.  If you're doing major work, they may impose
		  special conditions on you, require loading
		  calculations and ask other questions.  At this point
		  they will tell you which inspections you will need.
		- If you're installing a main panel, you will need to
		  have the panel and service connections inspected
		  before your power utility will provide a connection.
		  This is sometimes done by the local power authority
		  rather than the usual inspectors.
		- After installing the boxes and wiring, but before
		  the insulation/walls go up, you will need a
		  ""rough-in"" inspection.
		- After the walls are up, and the wiring is complete,
		  you will need a ""final inspection"".

Subject: My house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations.
	Do I have to upgrade?

	In general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings,
	though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some
	cases).  However, any new work must be done according to the
	latest electrical code.  Also, if you do ``major'' work, you
	may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all
	of your system.  Check with your local electrical inspector.

Subject: A word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240

	One thing where things might get a bit confusing is the
	different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of
	a circuit.  One person might talk about 110V, another 117V
	or another 120V.  These are all, in fact, exactly the same
	thing...  In North America the utility companies are required
	to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house.
	This works out as two 120V +- 5% legs.  Additionally, since there
	are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not
	unreasonable to find 120V has dropped to 110V or 240V has dropped
	to 220V by the time the power reaches a wall outlet.  Especially
	at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run.  For a number
	of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness,
	different people choose call them by slightly different numbers.
	This FAQ has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110V"" and
	""220V"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will
	be.  Confusing?  A bit.  Just ignore it.

	One thing that might make this a little more understandable
	is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110V
	instead of 120V) value.  What this implies is that the device
	is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that
	low.

	208V is *not* the same as 240V.  208V is the voltage between
	phases of a 3-phase ""Y"" circuit that is 120V from neutral to any
	hot.   480V is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""Y""
	circuit that's 277V from hot to neutral.

	In keeping with 110V versus 120V strangeness, motors intended
	to run on 480V three phase are often labelled as 440V...

Subject: What does an electrical service look like?

	There are logically four wires involved with supplying the
	main panel with power.  Three of them will come from the utility
	pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere.

 	The bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded
 	into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes
 	to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where
	the main water pipe entering the house.  Watch out for galvanic
	action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)).
	This is the ""grounding conductor"".  It is there to make sure that
	the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground.  This wire
	normally carries no current.

	One of the other wires will be white (or black with white or
	yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black).  It is the neutral wire.
	It is connected to the ""centre tap"" (CEC; ""center tap"" in the
	NEC) of the distribution transformer supplying the power.  It
	is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often
	inside the panel).  The neutral and ground should not be connected
	anywhere else.  Otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen.

	Furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in
	a home.  Some codes require more than one grounding electrode.
	These will be connected together, or connected to the neutral
	at a common point - still one grounding system.  Adding additional
	grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house
	wiring is unsafe and contrary to code.

	If you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually
	brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are
	not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one
	neutral-ground connection).  However, in some situations 
	(certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do
	have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your
	inspector.

	The other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot""
	wires.  They are attached to the distribution transformer as
	well.

	The two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each
	other.  This means if you connect something to both hot wires,
	the voltage will be 220 volts.  If you connect something to the
	white and either of the two blacks you will get 110V.

	Some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them.
	This is either because the neutral and ground are connected
	together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one
	wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some
	rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110V only
	service).

Subject: What is a circuit?

	Inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires.
	These connections are then used to supply power to selected
	portions of the home.  There are three different combinations:
		1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110V circuit.
		2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220V circuit.
		3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220V circuit + neutral,
		   and/or two 110V circuits with a common neutral.

	(1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and
	lighting within your house.  (3) is usually used for supplying
	power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they
	often have need for both 220V and 110V, or for bringing several
	circuits from the panel box to a distribution point.  (2) is
	usually for special 220V motor circuits, electric heaters, or
	air conditioners.

	[Note: In the US, the NEC frequently permits a circuit similar
	to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there
	are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral
	and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing
	the neutral for 110V purposes - three prong plugs instead
	of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel.
	When connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles
	are required).  In our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but
	the NFPA claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 NEC,
	and found to be safe.  Check your local codes, or inquire as to
	local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is
	permissible.]

	(1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot,
	white for neutral, and bare for grounding.

	(2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a
	bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral.

	You will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground
	wire.  Since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the NEC and CEC
	requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends
	to indicate that it is a live wire.  Usually done with paint, nail
	polish or sometimes electrical tape.

	Each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the
	panel through a circuit breaker or fuse.

	There are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2)
	or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires.  Some places
	require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"",
	the other attaches to the motor).  This may or may not be an
	alternative to GFCI protection.

Subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"".

	According to the terminology in the CEC and NEC, the
	""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green
	or bare wire.  The word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when
	you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire.  Since the white
	wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the
	panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"".  However, the
	potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding
	conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should
	never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire
	as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected
	together in the panel.

	[But not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground
	separately from the main panel.  Usually.]

	In the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used
	for ""grounded conductor"".  This FAQ uses ""neutral"" simply to
	avoid potential confusion.  We recommend that you use ""neutral""
	too.  Thus the white wire is always (except in some light
	switch applications) neutral.  Not ground.

Subject: What does a fuse or breaker do?  What are the differences?

	Fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power
	to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels.  For
	example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should
	""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting.  As
	such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the
	wiring -- UL or CSA approval supposedly indicates that the
	equipment itself won't cause a fire.

	Fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt
	(safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby
	interrupting the power to the circuit.  Fuses trip relatively
	fast.  Which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have
	large startup current surges.  For motor circuits, you can use
	a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid
	tripping on momentary overloads.  A fusetron looks like a
	spring-loaded fuse.  A fuse can only trip once, then it must be
	replaced.

	Breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices.  They
	usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched
	into position against another contact.  When the current flow
	through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip
	heats up and bends.  By bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the
	spring pulls the contacts apart.  Circuit breakers behave
	similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to
	trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses.  With high
	overloads, they trip quickly.  Breakers can be reset a finite
	number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown
	when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which
	damages the contacts.  Thus, breakers should not be used in
	place of switches unless they are specially listed for the
	purpose.

	Neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se.  A dead
	short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even
	thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which
	can often cause severe damage.

Subject: Breakers?  Can't I use fuses?

	Statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher
	risk of causing a fire than breaker panels.  This is usually
	due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts
	corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse
	being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a
	penny"" trick.

	Since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better
	connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less.

	Fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload.  When
	a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting
	path.  Result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel,
	melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical
	distribution transformer and having your house burn down.
	Breakers don't do this.

	Many jurisdictions, particularly in Canada, no longer permit
	fuse panels in new installations.  The NEC does permit new
	fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special
	inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses)

	Some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse
	protection in addition to the breaker at the panel.  The fuse
	is there to protect the motor windings from overload.  Check the
	labeling on the unit.  This is usually only on large permanently
	installed motors.  The installation instructions will tell you
	if you need one.

Subject: What size wire should I use?

	For a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire.  For a 15 amp circuit,
	you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales).  For a long run,
	though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid
	voltage drops.  12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than
	14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with.

	Here's a quick table for normal situations.  Go up a size for
	more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or
	ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate
	heat easily:

		Gauge		Amps
		14		15
		12		20
		10		30
		8		40
		6		65
	
	We don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent
	on the application and precise wire type.

Subject: Where do these numbers come from?

	There are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup.
	The smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is.  When
	the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is
	more voltage drop in the wiring.  The former is why you need
	higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in
	conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long
	runs.

	Neither effect is very significant over very short distances.
	There are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller
	wire is allowed.  The obvious one is the line cord on most
	lamps.  Don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits
	one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger
	wire.

Subject: What does ""14-2"" mean?

	This is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors
	in a cable.  The first number specifies the gauge.  The second
	the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but
	remember there's usually an extra ground wire.  ""14-2"" means
	14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground.

	-2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire.  Sometimes
	the white is red instead for 220V circuits without neutral.  In
	the latter case, the sheath is usually red too.

	-3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire.
	Usually carrying 220V with neutral.

Subject: What is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""?  How are they
	used?

	A wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used
	to connect wires together.  ""Marrette"" or ""Marr connector""
	are trade names.  You'll usually use a lot of them in DIY wiring.

	In essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them
	together, then twist the wirenut on.

	Though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the
	wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically
	secure.

	There are many different sizes of wire nut.  You should check
	that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the
	quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together.

	Don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or
	your fingers.  Use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers,
	and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly.  Sometimes
	it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it
	goes in the wirenut properly.

	Some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical
	tape.  This is probably not a good idea - the inspector may
	tear it off during an inspection.  It's usually done because
	a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead
	of taping it, the connection should be redone.

Subject: What is a GFI/GFCI?

	A GFCI is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''.  It measures
	the current current flowing through the hot wire and the
	neutral wire.  If they differ by more than a few milliamps, the
	presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other
	path.  This may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of
	an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person.  Any
	of these situations is hazardous, so the GFCI trips, breaking
	the circuit.

	GFCIs do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks.  If,
	for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral
	leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a GFCI
	wouldn't help.  All of the current that passed from the hot
	lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the
	GFCI happy.

	The two pairs of connections on a GFCI outlet are not symmetric.
	One is labeled LOAD; the other, LINE.  The incoming power feed
	*must* be connected to the LINE side, or the outlet will not be
	protected.  The LOAD side can be used to protect all devices
	downstream from it.  Thus, a whole string of outlets can be
	covered by a single GFCI outlet.

Subject: Where should GFCIs be used?

	The NEC mandates GFCIs for 110V, 15A or 20A single phase
	outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages,
	unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or
	just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water
	or dampness.  There are exceptions for inaccessible outlets,
	those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'',
	typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and
	laundry appliances.

	The CEC does not mandate as many GFCIs.  In particular, there
	is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or
	basement outlets.  Basement outlets must be protected if you
	have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to
	outside.  Bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have GFCIs.

	Even if you are not required to have GFCI protection, you may
	want to consider installing it anyway.  Unless you need a GFCI
	breaker (see below), the cost is low.  In the U.S., GFCI
	outlets can cost as little as US$8.  (Costs are a bit higher in
	Canada:  C$12.)  Evaluate your own risk factors.  Does your
	finished basement ever get wet?  Do you have small children?
	Do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools?  Does
	water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage?

Subject: Where shouldn't I use a GFCI?

	GFCIs are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a
	safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run
	unattended for long periods of time.  Refrigerators, freezers,
	and sump pumps are good examples.  The rationale is that GFCIs
	are sometimes prone to nuisance trips.  Some people claim that
	the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary
	current imbalance, tripping the GFCI.  Note, though, that most
	GFCI trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no
	apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring
	before deciding that the GFCI is broken or useless.

Subject: What is the difference between a GFCI outlet and a GFCI breaker?

	For most situations, you can use either a GFCI outlet as the
	first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with
	a built-in GFCI.  The former is generally preferred, since GFCI
	breakers are quite expensive.  For example, an ordinary GE
	breaker costs ~US$5; the GFCI model costs ~US$35.  There is one
	major exception:  if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch
	circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire),
	such as a Canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a
	multi-pole GFCI breaker.  Unfortunately, these are expensive;
	the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on
	what brand of panel box you have.  But if you must protect such
	a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice.

	One more caveat -- GFCI outlets are bulky.  You may want to use
	an oversize box when installing them.  On second thought, use
	large (actually deep) boxes everywhere.  You'll thank yourself for it.

	Incidentally, if you're installing a GFCI to ensure that one
	specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't
	really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first
	outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet
	in the bathroom, and not GFCI anything upstream of it.  But
	protecting the whole circuit is preferred.

	When you install a GFCI, it's a good idea to use the little
	""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark
	the outlets downstream of the GFCI.  You can figure out which
	outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the GFCI with the
	test button and see which outlets are dead.

Subject: What's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then?

	Apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on,
	and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without
	a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against
	insulation failures within the device.  Generally, the case of
	the appliance is connected to the ground lead.  If there's an
	insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the
	ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly
	trips the circuit breaker in the process).  If the case is not
	grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if
	you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped.  Of
	course, if the circuit is GFCI-protected, it will be a very
	tiny zap -- which is why you can use GFCIs to replace
	ungrounded outlets (both NEC and CEC).

	There are some appliances that should *never* be grounded.  In
	particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with
	exposed conductors.  Consider:  if you touch the heating
	electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will
	happen.  If you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock;
	the resistance will be too high.  But if the case were
	grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to
	ground...

Subject: Why is one prong wider than the other?  Polarization

	Nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the
	other.  This is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!)
	on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot.
	This is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the
	the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to
	have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios).

	Most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too.

	This requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right
	way around.  You want the wide prong to be neutral, and the
	narrow one hot.  Most outlets have a darker metal for the
	hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral.
	If not, you can usually figure out which is which by which
	prong the terminating screw connects to.

Subject: What kind of outlets do I need in a kitchen?

	The NEC requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance
	circuits'' for kitchens.  The CEC requires split-duplex
	receptacles.  Outlets must be installed such that no point is more
	than 24"" (NEC) (900 mm CEC) from an outlet.  Every counter wider
	than 12"" (NEC) or 300 mm (CEC) must have at least one outlet.
	The circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except
	in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room.  Furthermore, these circuits
	are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves,
	lighting, etc.  Non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be
	protected by a GFCI (NEC only).

	Split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220V circuit.  The tab
	is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to
	the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet.
	The neutral connects to both outlets through one screw.  When
	""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be
	pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral
	connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect
	from downstream outlets.

Subject: Where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms?

	There must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to
	the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in
	the light fixture.  All such outlets *must* be GFCI-protected.

Subject: What is Romex/NM/NMD?  What is BX?  When should I use each?

	Romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire.
	Sometimes called non-metallic sheath.  The formal name is NM.
	This is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside
	stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject
	to mechanical damage or excessive heat.  Most newer homes are
	wired almost exclusively with NM wire.  There are several
	different categories of NM cable.

	BX cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""AC"" has a
	flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is
	fairly resistant to damage.

	TECK cable is AC with an additional external thermoplastic
	sheath.
	
	Protection for cable in concealed locations: where NM or AC cable
	is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer
	surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (CEC & NEC)
	from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected
	from mechanical injury.  This latter protection can take the form of
	metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit.

	[Note: inspector-permitted practise in Canada suggests that armored
	cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection,
	but this is technically illegal.]

	Additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the
	Canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague
	references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the NEC
	and CEC):

	    - NM cable should be protected against mechanical damage
	      where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls
	      in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor.
	      Ie: use AC instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc.
	    - Where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces
	      or water heaters, the wire should be protected.  Canadian
	      practise is usually to install a junction or outlet
	      box on the wall, and use a short length of AC cable
	      or NM cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance.
	      Stapling NM to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used.
	    - Where NM cable is run in close proximity to heating
	      ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by
	      means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation
	      material (a wad of fiberglass).
	    - NM cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box
	      or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'.
	      Holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"".
	      Some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to
	      each box.  [while fishing cable is technically in violation,
	      it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical]
	    - 2 conductor NM cable should never be stapled on edge.
	      [Knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring
	      to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured
	      in the breach...]
	    - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or
	      similar finish.
	    - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards.
	    - Cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists
	      or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more
	      than 1m (39"").

	Whenever BX cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small
	plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to
	prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through
	the insulation.

	BX is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by
	solid wall coverings.

	In places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of
	a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a
	UL- (or CSA-) approved metal pipe.  You use various types of
	fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the
	wire.

	Service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit.

	In damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will
	need special wire (eg: CEC NMW90, NEC UF).  NMW90 looks like
	very heavy-duty NMD90.  You will usually need short lengths of
	conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground.  [See underground
	wiring section.]

 	Thermoplastic sheath wire (such as NM, NMW etc.) should not be
 	exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that
 	purpose.

	Many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through
	furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed
	by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces.   The reason for this
	is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses
	from burning insulation very rapidly through the building.
	Teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas.
	
 	Canada appears to use similar wire designations to the US,
 	except that Canadian wire designations usually include the
 	temperature rating in Celsius.  Eg: ""AC90"" versus ""AC"".
	In the US, NM-B is 90 degrees celcius.

	NOTE: local codes vary.  This is one of the items that changes
	most often.  Eg: Chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*.
	There are very different requirements for mobile homes.
	Check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything
	that's the slightest out of the ordinary.

Subject: Should I use plastic or metal boxes?

	The NEC permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable
	only.  The reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box
	itself provides ground conductor continuity.  U.S. plastic
	boxes don't use metal cable clamps.

	The CEC is slightly different.  The CEC never permits cable
	armor as a grounding conductor.  However, you must still
	provide ground continuity for metallic sheath.  The CEC also
	requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes.

	The advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for
	non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground
	connection and they sometimes cost a little less.  On the other
	hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts.  For
	exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better.

Subject: Junction box positioning?

	A junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together.

	Junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible
	later.  Ie: not buried under plaster.  Excessive use of junction
	boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may
	get nasty.

Subject: Can I install a replacement light fixture?

	In general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few
	caveats.  First, of course, one should check the amperage
	rating of the circuit.  If your heart is set on installing half
	a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire
	back to the panel box.  But there are some more subtle
	constraints as well.  For example, older house
	wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation.  The excess
	heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the
	insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results.
	Some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high
	temperature wire only.  (You may find, in fact, that your
	ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case
	replacing any devices is a real adventure.)

	Other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some
	fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and
	its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy
	chandelier or ceiling fan.  You may need to install a new box
	specifically listed for this purpose.  A 2x4 across the ceiling
	joists makes a good support.  Metal brackets are also available
	that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and
	mounted between the joists.

	There are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as
	""pot"" lamps or heat lamps.  When these are installed in insulated
	ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard.
	The CEC provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated
	ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually
	8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering
	with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation.  (Yes, that's 8 *feet*
	long)

	NEC rules are somewhat less stringent.  They require at least 3""
	clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation.
	The rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement,
	which means that a CEC-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile.
	Presumably, that's up to the local inspector.  [The CEC doesn't
	actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector
	requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get
	accidentally buried in insulation.  Ie: if you have insulation blown
	in later.]

	There are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and
	fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation.  They are
	usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat
	more expensive than the older types.  Before you use them, you should
	ensure that they have explicit UL or CSA approval for such uses.
	Follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location
	for the sensor can vary.

	There does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved
	for use in insulation.  The ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach.

Subject: What does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts?

	This usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is
	loose.  Depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up
	being more than 110V, and the other less than 110V, with
	respect to ground.  This is a very hazardous situation - it can
	destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in
	some situations electrocute you (ie: some US jurisdictions
	require the stove frame connected to neutral).

	If this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately
	and have them come and check out the problem.

	Note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with
	lighting and motors on the same 220V with neutral circuit.  A
	loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness
	far longer than one second.  In case of doubt, get help.

Subject: What is 3 phase power?  Should I use it?  Can I get it in my house?

	Three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of
	phase with each other.  These are usually used for large motors
	because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque,
	and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper.

	You're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows
	110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between
	any two hots.  The latter shows the difference between a normal
	220V/110V common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the
	two hots.  There are 3 phase circuits with different voltages.

	Bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually
	ridiculously expensive, or impossible.  If the equipment you
	want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *MUCH* cheaper to
	buy a new 110V or 220V motor for it.  In some cases it is
	possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have
	a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a
	(auto-)generator.  These are tricky, but are a good solution if
	the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to
	replace.  The Taunton Press book ``The Small Shop'' has an
	article on how to do this if you must.

	Note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using
	such a converter.  The laws of thermodynamics guarantee that.

Subject: Is it better to run motors at 110 or 220?

	Theoretically, it doesn't make any difference.  However, there
	is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply
	wiring.  All things being equal, a 220V motor will lose 4 times
	less power in the house wiring than a 110V motor.  This also
	means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor
	will get to speed quicker.  And in some circumstances, the
	smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life.

	This is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more
	than 50 feet long.

Subject: What is this nonsense about 3HP on 110V 15A circuits?

	It is a universal physical law that 1 HP is equal to 746
	watts.  Given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies,
	it is usually best to consider 1 HP is going to need 1000-1200
	watts.  A 110V 15A circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor,
	so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 HP.  Given rational
	efficiency factors, 1.5HP is more like it.

	Some equipment manufacturers (Sears in particular, most router
	manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a HP rating that is far
	in excess of what is possible.  They are giving you a ""stall
	horsepower"" or similar.  That means the power is measured when
	the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load.
	What they don't mention is that if you kept it in that
	condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker
	will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far
	more current than it can continuously.

	When comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower.  This
	should be on the motor nameplate.  If you can't find that figure,
	check the amperage rating, which is always present.

Subject: How do I convert two prong receptacles to three prong?

	Older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead
	of the more modern three.  These receptacles have no safety
	ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire.  Neither
	the NEC or CEC permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore.

	There are several different approaches to solving this:
	    1) If the wiring is done through conduit or BX, and the
	       conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect
	       the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle
	       box.  NEC mainly - CEC frowns on this practise.
	    2) If there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and
	       it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can
	       run a conductor to it from the third prong.
	    3) Run a ground conductor back to the main panel.
	    4) Easiest: install a GFCI receptacle.  The ground lug
	       should not be connected to anything, but the GFCI
	       protection itself will serve instead.  The GFCI
	       will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong
	       outlets).  If you do this to protect downstream outlets,
	       the grounds must not be connected together.  Since it
	       wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault
	       could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected
	       to other outlets.  Be sure, though, that there aren't
	       indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath
	       on BX cable.

	The CEC permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three
	prong if you fill the U ground with a non-conducting goop.
	Like caulking compound.  This is not permitted in the NEC.

Subject: Are you sure about GFCIs and ungrounded outlets?
	Should the test button work?

	We're sure about what the NEC and CEC say.  Remember, though,
	that your local codes may vary.  As for the TEST button -- there's
	a resistor connecting the LOAD side of the hot wire to the LINE
	side of the neutral wire when you press the TEST button.  Current
	through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the GFCI.
	This is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require
	a real ground to work.  If your GFCI does not trip when you press
	the TEST button, it is very probably defective or miswired.  Again:
	if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially
	dangerous.  The problem should be corrected immediately.

	The instructions that come with some GFCIs specify that the ground
	wire must be connected.  We do not know why they say this.  The
	causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the
	formalities of UL or CSA listing -- perhaps the device was never
	tested without the ground wire being connected.  On the other hand,
	UL or CSA approval should only have been granted if the device
	behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded
	outlet replacement.  (One of us called Leviton; their GFCIs are
	labeled for installation on grounded circuits only.  The technician
	was surprised to see that; he agreed that the NEC does not require
	it, and promised to investigate.)

Subject: How should I wire my shop?

	As with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all
	devices that will be on simultaneously.  The code specifies
	that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the
	circuit.  For typical home shop use, this means one circuit for
	the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or
	shop vac.  Use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have
	big motors, with a big start-up surge.  If you can, use 20 amp
	breakers (NEC), though CEC requires standard 20A receptacles
	which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment.  Lights
	should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared
	with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two
	separate circuits.  The idea is that you want to avoid a
	situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand
	RPM, while you're groping in the dark for the OFF switch.

	Do install lots of outlets.  It's easier to install them in the
	beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable.
	It's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each
	point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same
	time as the tool you really want.  But use metal boxes and
	plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have
	objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit
	wrong.

	Note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring""
	rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used
	for working.  What this means is that all wiring must be
	run along structural members.  Ie: stapled to studs.

	Other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220V
	circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits.
	Don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you
	can help it, unless they're rated for high currents.  (A coiled
	extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of
	the same gauge.  Also, the insulation won't withstand as much
	heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.)

	If your shop is located at some remove from your main panel,
	you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop
	wiring from it.  If you have young children, you may want to
	equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock.
	If you want to install individual switches to ``safe''
	particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough.
	For example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to
	handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw.  Buy
	``horsepower-rated'' switches instead.

	Finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished
	basements; hence the NEC requirements for GFCIs apply.  And
	even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop
	outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might
	have a different idea.

	Note: Fine Woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop
	wiring.  April 1992 is one place to start.

Subject: Underground Wiring

	You will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use
	special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic
	tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots
	thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion
	of lead).  The transition from in-house to underground wire is
	generally via conduit.  All outdoor boxes must be specifically
	listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets,
	fittings, etc.  If the location of the box is subject to immersion
	in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed.  And
	of course, don't forget the GFCIs.

	The required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to
	jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about
	your specific situation.

	A hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power
	line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed.

Subject: Aluminum wiring

	During the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became
	quite popular and was extensively used.  Since that time,
	aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires,
	and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations.
	We recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new
	wiring.

	But don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring.  Aluminum
	wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper.
	Aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper
	installation.  We will cover a bit of the theory behind potential
	problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe.

	The main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as
	""cold creep"".  When aluminum wiring warms up, it expands.  When
	it cools down, it contracts.  Unlike copper, when aluminum goes
	through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each
	time.  To make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes
	when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance
	of the connection goes up.  Which causes it to heat up and corrode/
	oxidize still more.  Eventually the wire may start getting very hot,
	melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even
	cause a fire.

	Since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move
	into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of
	safe aluminum wiring.  We suggest that, if you're considering purchasing
	a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you
	hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring
	for the following things:

	    1) Fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to
	       aluminum wiring should be rated for it.  The device will
	       be stamped with ""Al/Cu"" or ""CO/ALR"".  The latter supersedes
	       the former, but both are safe.   These fixtures are somewhat
	       more expensive than the ordinary ones.

	    2) Wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around
	       the screw in a clockwise direction).  Connections should be
	       tight.  While repeated tightening of the screws can make the
	       problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug
	       up each connection.

	       Note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the
	       main service entrance cable.  It should be inspected.

	    3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire.
	       Any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with
	       the proper screw connections immediately.

	    4) There should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections,
	       melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures.  Any such damage should
	       be repaired.
	    
	    5) Connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be
	       handled specially.  Current Canadian codes require that the
	       wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting
	       aluminum to copper.  The NEC requires that the wire be
	       connected together using special crimp devices, with an
	       anti-oxidant grease.  The tools and materials for the latter
	       are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless
	       you can rent the tool.

	    6) Any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring
	       by means of a short copper ""pigtail"".  See (5) above.
	    
	    7) Shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped
	       (not nicked) wire etc.
    
	If, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring
	shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider
	the wiring safe.  If there are signs of problems in many places,
	we suggest you look elsewhere.  If the wrong receptacles are used,
	you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having
	this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch.
	You can do this yourself too.

Subject: I'm buying a house!  What should I do?

	Congratulations.  But...  It's generally a good idea to hire
	an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas.
	Not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well.  If an
	inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor
	ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any
	minor problems are fixed).  If there are signs of problems in many
	places, we suggest you look elsewhere.

	Here's some hints on what to look for:

	Obvious non-code wiring can include:

		- Zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls
		- Hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without
		  proper marking.
		- Ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of
		  a GFCI)
		- Splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube)
		- Switched neutrals
		- Unsecured Romex swinging about like grapevines

	Certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one
	time) sometimes reveal DIY wiring that may have hidden violations:

		- Switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps
		   not properly terminated wiring)
		- A wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are
		  separately controlled by other wall switches.  (except when
		  it's *really* convenient ;-)
		- Switches and outlets in bizarre locations
		- Great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps
		- Junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them
		- Wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or
		  ceiling
		- Backwrapped grounding wires

Subject: What is this weird stuff?  Old style wiring
	
	In the years since Edison ""invented"" electricity, several different
	wiring ""styles"" have come and gone.  When you buy an older home you
	may encounter some of this stuff.  This section describes the old 
	methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies.

	The oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called
	""knob and tube"" (K&T).  It is made up of individual conductors with
	a cloth insulation.  The wires are run along side structural
	members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs).
	Wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes.  Connections
	were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping
	with tape.  Since the hot and neutral were run separately,
	the wiring tends to be rather confusing.  A neutral often runs
	down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture.
	The hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next.  In some
	cases K&T isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same
	colour as the hot wires.

	You'll see K&T in homes built as late as the 40's.

	Comments on K&T:

		- the people installing K&T were pretty paranoid about
		  electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good.
		- The wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up
		  very well.  Most K&T I've seen, for example, is in
		  quite good condition.
		- No grounding.  Grounding is usually difficult to install.
		- boxes are small.  Receptacle replacement (particularly with
		  GFCI) can be difficult.  No bushing on boxes either,
		  so wiring changes need special attention to box entry.
		- Sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between
		  separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to
		  overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on
		  any circuit.
		- Building code does not permit insulation in walls
		  that contain K&T.
		- Connection to existing K&T from new circuits can be
		  tricky.  Consult your inspector.
		- Modern wiring practise requires considerably more
		  outlets to be installed than K&T systems did.
	
	Since K&T tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't
	necessary to replace it simply because it's K&T.  What you should
	watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and
	be cautious about circuit loading.  In many cases it's perfectly
	reasonable to leave existing K&T alone, and add new fixtures on
	new circuits using modern techniques.
	
	After K&T, they invented multi-conductor cable.  The first type
	you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation.  It looks
	much like the romex cable of the last decade or two.  This stuff was
	used in the 40's and 50's.  Again, no grounding conductor.
	It was installed much like modern wiring.  Its major drawback
	is that this type of insulation embrittles.  We've seen whole
	systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at
	a touch.  BX cable of the same vintage has similar problems.

	This stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if
	the wires become bare.  This wiring should be left untouched as
	much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it.
	A simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several
	hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink
	tubing.

	After this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented.
	It's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth.  Often a bit sticky.
	This stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard
	and is reasonably easy to work with.  It does not need to be
	replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff -
	thermoplastic insulation wire.  Just don't abuse it too much.

Subject: Where do I buy stuff?

	Try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you.  Their
	prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or
	DIY centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety
	including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that
	know what you're talking about.  Cultivate friendly knowledgeable
	sales people.  They'll give you much valuable information.

(and in some parts of canada), canada is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of the u.s. consequently, the nec does not apply in canada. lots of things are the same, including voltages, line frequencies, and the laws of physics. but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations. where we can, we've noted them, flagging the relevant passages with ``nec'' or ``cec''. remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards. it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements. subject: what is the nec? where can i get a copy? the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association, an insurance industry group. it's revised every three years. the 1993 version has been released. you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore, or by calling them directly at 800-344-3555. the code exists in several versions. there's the full text, which is fairly incomprehensible. there's an abridged edition, which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses. and there's the nec handbook, which contains the ``authorized commentary'' on the code, as well as the full text. that's the recommended version. unfortunately, there's no handbook for the abridged edition. and the full handbook is expensive -- us$65 plus shipping and handling. subject: what is the cec? where can i get a copy? the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies, power utilities, insurance companies, electrical manufacturers and other organizations. the csa publishes csa standard c22.1 which is updated every two or three years. each province adopts, with some amendments, this standard and publishes a province-specific code book. since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard, it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself. in this faq, ""cec"" really means the appropriate provincial standard. in particular, this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code, 20th edition (1990). which is in turn based on csa c22.1-1990 (16th edition). while differences exist between the provinces, an attempt has been made to avoid specific-to-ontario detail. the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority. in ontario, it's ontario hydro. the ontario hydro book isn't overly fat. it's about c$25, and includes mailed updates. i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications. don't bother asking in quebec - diy wiring is banned throughout the province. subject: can i do my own wiring? extra pointers? in most places, homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring. in some, they're not. check with your local electrical inspector. most places won't permit you to do wiring on other's homes for money without a license. nor are you permitted to do wiring in ""commercial"" buildings. multiple dwellings (eg: duplexes) are usually considered ""semi-commercial"" or ""commercial"". however, many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi-commercial wiring if you're supervised by a licensed electrician - if you can find one willing to supervise. if you do your own wiring, an important point: do it neat and well! what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do. after all, it's your own home, and it's you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake. an electrician has time pressures, has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast, safe job. in this faq we've consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code, because we feel that it's reasonable, and will impress the inspector. the inspector will know that you're an amateur. you have to earn his trust. the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible. don't cut corners. exceed specifications. otherwise, the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions. don't try to hide anything from the inspector. use the proper tools. ie: don't use a bread knife to strip wires, or twist wires with your fingers. the inspector won't like it, and the results won't be that safe. and it takes longer. and you're more likely to stick a hunk of 12ga wire through your hand that way. don't handle house wire when it's very cold (eg: below -10c or 16f). thermoplastic house wire, particularly older types become very brittle. subject: what do i need in the way of tools? first, there's the obvious -- a hammer, a drill, a few screwdrivers, both straight and phillips-head. if you're lucky enough to live in canada (or find a source of csa-approved devices) you need robertson (""square recess"") screwdrivers (#1 and #2) instead of phillips. for drilling a few holes, a 3/4"" or 1"" spade bit and 1/4"" or 3/8"" electric drill will do. if you're doing a lot, or are working with elderly lumber, we recommend a 1/2"" drill (right-angle drills are wonderful. can be rented) and 3/4"" or 1"" screw-point auger drill bits. these bits pull you through, so they're much faster and less fatiguing, even in 90 year old hardwood timbers. screw-driver bits are useful for drills, expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws (drywall screws work well). for stripping wire, use a real wire stripper, not a knife or ordinary wire cutters. don't buy the $3 k-mart ""combo stripper, crimper and bottle opener"" types. you should expect to pay $15 to $20 for a good ""plier-type"" pair. it will have sized stripping holes, and won't nick or grab the wire - it should be easy to strip wire with it. one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals. there are fancier types (autostrip/cut), but they generally aren't necessary, and pros usually don't use them. a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places. don't use these for stripping wire. you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts. you should have a pair of needle-nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops, but it's better to form wire loops with a ""loop former hole"" on your wire stripper - more accurate. if you're using non-metallic cable, get a cable stripper for removing the sheath. or, do what some pros do, they nick the end of the sheath, grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers, and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a ""zipper"", and cut the sheath off. you shouldn't try to strip the sheath with a knife point, because it's too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors. apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters (hooked blades) can be used to strip sheath, but there is still the possibility that you'll gouge the conductors. for any substantial amount of work with armored cable, it's well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter (~us$ 18). hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation. three-prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly-wired outlets. about $6. multimeters tell you more, but are a lot more expensive, and probably not worth it for most people. a simple voltage sensor, which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices, is extremely helpful; they cost about us$ 10 at radio shack. you should have a voltage detector - to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them. neon-bulb version are cheap ($2-3) and work well. if you get more serious, a ""audible alarm"" type is good for tracing circuits without a helper. (though i've been known to lock the drill on, and hit breakers until the scream stops ;-) for running wires through existing walls, you need fish tape. often, two tapes are needed, though sometimes, a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice. fish tapes can be rented. electrical tape. lots of it ;-) seriously, a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape. the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work. another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws - i don't do this, but drywall contractors prefer it (to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate). subject: what is ul listing? the ul stands for ""underwriters laboratory"". it used to be an insurance industry organization, but now it is independent and non-profit. it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards. when something is ul-listed, that means that the ul has tested the device, and it meets their requirements for safety - ie: fire or shock hazard. it doesn't necessarily mean that the device actually does what it's supposed to, just that it probably won't kill you. the ul does not have power of law in the u.s. -- you are permitted to buy and install non-ul-listed devices. however, insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non-ul-listed device. furthermore, in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ul-listed for that purpose. indirectly, this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ul-listed before an inspector will approve it and/or occupancy permits issued. subject: what is csa approval? every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada. implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csa-approved materials. they perform testing similar to the ul (a bit more stringent), except that csa approval is required by law. again, like the ul, if a fire was caused by non-csa-approved equipment, your insurance company may not have to pay the claim. in canada, there is a branch organization of the ul, called ulc (ul of canada). ulc does not have power of law, and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies. subject: are there any cheaper, easier to read books on wiring? usa: the following three books were suggested by our readers residential wiring by jeff markell, craftsman books, carlsbad ca for $18.25. isbn 0-934041-19-9. practical electrical wiring residential, farm and industrial, based on the national electrical code ansi/nfpa 70 herbert p. richter and w. creighton schwan mcgraw-hill book co. wiring simplified h. p. richter and w. c. schwan park publishing co. try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision. which is currently 1990. canada: p.s. knight authors and publishes a book called ""electrical code simplified"". there appears to be a version published specific to each province, and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code. it focuses on residential wiring, and is indispensible for canadian diy'ers. it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring (or answer questions on the net ;-). it is updated each time the provincial codes are. this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c$10. subject: inspections how and what? why should i get my wiring inspected? most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done. amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons (like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims), a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you, your family, your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don't get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job. most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home, or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit. california, for instance, is particularly nasty about this. if fire starts in your home, and un-inspected wiring is at fault, insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims. in general, the process goes like this: - you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit. you should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing. this is a good time to ask questions on any things you're not sure of. if you're doing major work, they may impose special conditions on you, require loading calculations and ask other questions. at this point they will tell you which inspections you will need. - if you're installing a main panel, you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection. this is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors. - after installing the boxes and wiring, but before the insulation/walls go up, you will need a ""rough-in"" inspection. - after the walls are up, and the wiring is complete, you will need a ""final inspection"". subject: my house doesn't meet some of these rules and regulations. do i have to upgrade? in general, there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings, though there are some exceptions (ie: smoke detectors in some cases). however, any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code. also, if you do ``major'' work, you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system. check with your local electrical inspector. subject: a word on voltages: 110/115/117/120/125/220/240 one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit. one person might talk about 110v, another 117v or another 120v. these are all, in fact, exactly the same thing... in north america the utility companies are required to supply a split-phase 240 volt (+-5%) feed to your house. this works out as two 120v +- 5% legs. additionally, since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring, it's not unreasonable to find 120v has dropped to 110v or 240v has dropped to 220v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet. especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run. for a number of reasons, some historical, some simple personal orneryness, different people choose call them by slightly different numbers. this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them ""110v"" and ""220v"", except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be. confusing? a bit. just ignore it. one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower (ie: 110v instead of 120v) value. what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low. 208v is *not* the same as 240v. 208v is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""y"" circuit that is 120v from neutral to any hot. 480v is the voltage between phases of a 3-phase ""y"" circuit that's 277v from hot to neutral. in keeping with 110v versus 120v strangeness, motors intended to run on 480v three phase are often labelled as 440v... subject: what does an electrical service look like? there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power. three of them will come from the utility pole, and a fourth (bare) wire comes from elsewhere. the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground, or to a wire buried in the foundation, or sometimes to the water supply pipe (has to be metal, continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house. watch out for galvanic action conductivity ""breaks"" (often between copper and iron pipe)). this is the ""grounding conductor"". it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground. this wire normally carries no current. one of the other wires will be white (or black with white or yellow stripes, or sometimes simply black). it is the neutral wire. it is connected to the ""centre tap"" (cec; ""center tap"" in the nec) of the distribution transformer supplying the power. it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place (often inside the panel). the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else. otherwise, weird and/or dangerous things may happen. furthermore, there should only be one grounding system in a home. some codes require more than one grounding electrode. these will be connected together, or connected to the neutral at a common point - still one grounding system. adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code. if you add a subpanel, the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel, and are not connected together in the subpanel (ie: still only one neutral-ground connection). however, in some situations (certain categories of separate buildings) you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode - consult your inspector. the other two wires will usually be black, and are the ""hot"" wires. they are attached to the distribution transformer as well. the two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each other. this means if you connect something to both hot wires, the voltage will be 220 volts. if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get 110v. some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them. this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point (eg: the meter or pole) and one wire is doing dual-duty as both neutral and ground, or in some rare occasions, the service has only one hot wire (110v only service). subject: what is a circuit? inside the panel, connections are made to the incoming wires. these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home. there are three different combinations: 1) one hot, one neutral, and ground: 110v circuit. 2) two hots, no neutral, and ground: 220v circuit. 3) two hots, neutral, and ground: 220v circuit + neutral, and/or two 110v circuits with a common neutral. (1) is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house. (3) is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves, and dryers - they often have need for both 220v and 110v, or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point. (2) is usually for special 220v motor circuits, electric heaters, or air conditioners. [note: in the us, the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to (2) be used for stoves and dryers - namely, that there are two hot wires, and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground, and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for 110v purposes - three prong plugs instead of four (*only* for stoves/dryers connected to the main panel. when connected to most sub-panels, 4 prong plugs and receptacles are required). in our not-so-humble opinion this is crazy, but the nfpa claims that this practice was re-evaluated for the 1992 nec, and found to be safe. check your local codes, or inquire as to local practice -- there are restrictions on when this is permissible.] (1) is usually wired with three conductor wire: black for hot, white for neutral, and bare for grounding. (2) and (3) have one hot wire coloured red, the other black, a bare wire for grounding, and in (3) a white wire for neutral. you will sometimes see (2) wired with just a black, white and ground wire. since the white is ""hot"" in this case, both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be ""permanently marked"" at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire. usually done with paint, nail polish or sometimes electrical tape. each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse. there are, in a few locales, circuits that look like (1), (2) or (3) except that they have two bare ground wires. some places require this for hot tubs and the like (one ground is ""frame ground"", the other attaches to the motor). this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection. subject: ""grounding"" versus ""grounded"" versus ""neutral"". according to the terminology in the cec and nec, the ""grounding"" conductor is for the safety ground, i.e., the green or bare wire. the word ""neutral"" is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one ""hot"" wire. since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel, the proper term is ""grounded conductor"". however, the potential confusion between ""grounded conductor"" and ""grounding conductor"" can lead to potentially lethal mistakes - you should never use the bare wire as a ""grounded conductor"" or white wire as the ""grounding conductor"", even though they are connected together in the panel. [but not in subpanels - subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel. usually.] in the trade, and in common usage, the word ""neutral"" is used for ""grounded conductor"". this faq uses ""neutral"" simply to avoid potential confusion. we recommend that you use ""neutral"" too. thus the white wire is always (except in some light switch applications) neutral. not ground. subject: what does a fuse or breaker do? what are the differences? fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels. for example, if your toaster shorts out, a fuse or breaker should ""trip"", protecting the wiring in the walls from melting. as such, fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring -- ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won't cause a fire. fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt (safely) when the current exceeds the rated value, thereby interrupting the power to the circuit. fuses trip relatively fast. which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges. for motor circuits, you can use a ""time-delay"" fuse (one brand is ""fusetron"") which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads. a fusetron looks like a spring-loaded fuse. a fuse can only trip once, then it must be replaced. breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices. they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact. when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value, a bimetallic strip heats up and bends. by bending it ""trips"" the latch, and the spring pulls the contacts apart. circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons - that is, they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses. with high overloads, they trip quickly. breakers can be reset a finite number of times - each time they trip, or are thrown when the circuit is in use, some arcing takes place, which damages the contacts. thus, breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose. neither fuses nor breakers ""limit"" the current per se. a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time, which can often cause severe damage. subject: breakers? can't i use fuses? statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels. this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in, or the contacts corroding and heating up over time, or the wrong size fuse being installed, or the proverbial ""replace the fuse with a penny"" trick. since breakers are more permanently installed, and have better connection mechanisms, the risk of fire is considerably less. fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload. when a fuse explodes, the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path. result? from complete meltdown of the electrical panel, melted service wiring, through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down. breakers don't do this. many jurisdictions, particularly in canada, no longer permit fuse panels in new installations. the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances (requiring the special inserts to ""key"" the fuseholder to specific size fuses) some devices, notably certain large air conditioners, require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel. the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload. check the labeling on the unit. this is usually only on large permanently installed motors. the installation instructions will tell you if you need one. subject: what size wire should i use? for a 20 amp circuit, use 12 gauge wire. for a 15 amp circuit, you can use 14 gauge wire (in most locales). for a long run, though, you should use the next larger size wire, to avoid voltage drops. 12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 14 gauge, though it's stiffer and harder to work with. here's a quick table for normal situations. go up a size for more than 100 foot runs, when the cable is in conduit, or ganged with other wires in a place where they can't dissipate heat easily: gauge amps 14 15 12 20 10 30 8 40 6 65 we don't list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type. subject: where do these numbers come from? there are two considerations, voltage drop and heat buildup. the smaller the wire is, the higher the resistance is. when the resistance is higher, the wire heats up more, and there is more voltage drop in the wiring. the former is why you need higher-temperature insulation and/or bigger wires for use in conduit; the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs. neither effect is very significant over very short distances. there are some very specific exceptions, where use of smaller wire is allowed. the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps. don't try this unless you're certain that your use fits one of those exceptions; you can never go wrong by using larger wire. subject: what does ""14-2"" mean? this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable. the first number specifies the gauge. the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire - but remember there's usually an extra ground wire. ""14-2"" means 14 gauge, two insulated current carrying wires, plus bare ground. -2 wire usually has a black, white and bare ground wire. sometimes the white is red instead for 220v circuits without neutral. in the latter case, the sheath is usually red too. -3 wire usually has a black, red, white and bare ground wire. usually carrying 220v with neutral. subject: what is a ""wirenut""/""marrette""/""marr connector""? how are they used? a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that's used to connect wires together. ""marrette"" or ""marr connector"" are trade names. you'll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring. in essence, you strip the end of the wires about an inch, twist them together, then twist the wirenut on. though some wirenuts advertise that you don't need to twist the wire, do it anyways - it's more mechanically and electrically secure. there are many different sizes of wire nut. you should check that the wire nut you're using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you're connecting together. don't just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers. use a pair of blunt nose (""linesman"") pliers, and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly. sometimes it's a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly. some people wrap the ""open"" end of the wirenut with electrical tape. this is probably not a good idea - the inspector may tear it off during an inspection. it's usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut - instead of taping it, the connection should be redone. subject: what is a gfi/gfci? a gfci is a ``ground-fault circuit interrupter''. it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire. if they differ by more than a few milliamps, the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path. this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance, or to the ground lead, or through a person. any of these situations is hazardous, so the gfci trips, breaking the circuit. gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks. if, for example, you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit, and no part of you was grounded, a gfci wouldn't help. all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead, keeping the gfci happy. the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric. one is labeled load; the other, line. the incoming power feed *must* be connected to the line side, or the outlet will not be protected. the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it. thus, a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet. subject: where should gfcis be used? the nec mandates gfcis for 110v, 15a or 20a single phase outlets, in bathrooms, kitchens within 6' of the sink, garages, unfinished basements or crawl spaces, outdoors, near a pool, or just about anywhere else where you're likely to encounter water or dampness. there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets, those dedicated to appliances ``occupying fixed space'', typically refrigerators and freezers, and for sump pumps and laundry appliances. the cec does not mandate as many gfcis. in particular, there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets, or most garage or basement outlets. basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor, garage outlets if they're near the door to outside. bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis. even if you are not required to have gfci protection, you may want to consider installing it anyway. unless you need a gfci breaker (see below), the cost is low. in the u.s., gfci outlets can cost as little as us$8. (costs are a bit higher in canada: c$12.) evaluate your own risk factors. does your finished basement ever get wet? do you have small children? do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools? does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage? subject: where shouldn't i use a gfci? gfcis are generally not used on circuits that (a) don't pose a safety risk, and (b) are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time. refrigerators, freezers, and sump pumps are good examples. the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips. some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance, tripping the gfci. note, though, that most gfci trips are real; if you're getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason, you'd be well-advised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless. subject: what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker? for most situations, you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit, or you can install a breaker with a built-in gfci. the former is generally preferred, since gfci breakers are quite expensive. for example, an ordinary ge breaker costs ~us$5; the gfci model costs ~us$35. there is one major exception: if you need to protect a ``multi-wire branch circuit'' (two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire), such as a canadian-style kitchen circuit, you'll need a multi-pole gfci breaker. unfortunately, these are expensive; the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars, depending on what brand of panel box you have. but if you must protect such a circuit (say, for a pool heater), you have no choice. one more caveat -- gfci outlets are bulky. you may want to use an oversize box when installing them. on second thought, use large (actually deep) boxes everywhere. you'll thank yourself for it. incidentally, if you're installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected (such as a bathroom), you don't really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit, you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom, and not gfci anything upstream of it. but protecting the whole circuit is preferred. when you install a gfci, it's a good idea to use the little ""ground fault protected"" stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci. you can figure out which outlets are ""downstream"", simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead. subject: what's the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet, then? apart from their use in electronics, which we won't comment on, and for certain fluorescent lights (they won't turn on without a good ground connection), they're intended to guard against insulation failures within the device. generally, the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead. if there's an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case, the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely (and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process). if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs, the case is live -- and if you touch it while you're grounded, you'll get zapped. of course, if the circuit is gfci-protected, it will be a very tiny zap -- which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets (both nec and cec). there are some appliances that should *never* be grounded. in particular, that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors. consider: if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster, and you're not grounded, nothing will happen. if you're slightly grounded, you'll get a small shock; the resistance will be too high. but if the case were grounded, and you were holding it, you'd be the perfect path to ground... subject: why is one prong wider than the other? polarization nowadays, many two-prong devices have one prong wider than the other. this is so that the device could rely (not guaranteed!) on one specific wire being neutral, and the other hot. this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures, where the the shell should neutral (safety), or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference (ie: some radios). most 2-prong extension cords have wide prongs too. this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around. you want the wide prong to be neutral, and the narrow one hot. most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw, and lighter coloured screw for the neutral. if not, you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to. subject: what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen? the nec requires at least two 20 amp ``small appliance circuits'' for kitchens. the cec requires split-duplex receptacles. outlets must be installed such that no point is more than 24"" (nec) (900 mm cec) from an outlet. every counter wider than 12"" (nec) or 300 mm (cec) must have at least one outlet. the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen, pantry, or dining room. furthermore, these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators, stoves, microwaves, lighting, etc. non-dedicated outlets within 6' of a sink *must* be protected by a gfci (nec only). split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220v circuit. the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet, and one hot goes to the upper outlet, and the other hot goes to the lower outlet. the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw. when ""carrying through"" to another outlet, the neutral must be pigtailed, such that removing the outlet, or having the neutral connection fall off doesn't cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets. subject: where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms? there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom, adjacent to the sink, in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture. all such outlets *must* be gfci-protected. subject: what is romex/nm/nmd? what is bx? when should i use each? romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire. sometimes called non-metallic sheath. the formal name is nm. this is suitable for use in dry, protected areas (ie: inside stud walls, on the sides of joists etc.), that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat. most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire. there are several different categories of nm cable. bx cable -- technically known as armored cable or ""ac"" has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage. teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath. protection for cable in concealed locations: where nm or ac cable is run through studs, joists or similar wooden members, the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm/1.25"" (cec & nec) from the edges of the wooden members, or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury. this latter protection can take the form of metal plates (such as spare outlet box ends) or conduit. [note: inspector-permitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable, or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection, but this is technically illegal.] additional protection recommendations (these are rules in the canadian codes - they are reasonable answers to the vague references to ""exposed to mechanical damage"" in both the nec and cec): - nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor. ie: use ac instead, flexible conduit, wooden guards etc. - where cable is suspended, as in, connections to furnaces or water heaters, the wire should be protected. canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall, and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to ""jump"" to the appliance. stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used. - where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe, heat transfer should be minimized by means of a 25mm/1"" air space, or suitable insulation material (a wad of fiberglass). - nm cable shall be supported within 300mm/1' of every box or fitting, and at intervals of no more than 1.5m/5'. holes in joists or studs are considered ""supports"". some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box. [while fishing cable is technically in violation, it is permitted where ""proper"" support is impractical] - 2 conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge. [knight also insists on only one cable per staple, referring to the ""workmanship"" clause, but this seems more honoured in the breach...] - cable should never be buried in plaster, cement or similar finish. - cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards. - cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than 1m (39""). whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp, small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation. bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings. in places where damage is more likely (like on the back wall of a garage ;-), you may be required to use conduit, a ul- (or csa-) approved metal pipe. you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance/exit for the wire. service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit. in damp places (eg: buried wiring to outdoor lighting) you will need special wire (eg: cec nmw90, nec uf). nmw90 looks like very heavy-duty nmd90. you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters/exits the ground. [see underground wiring section.] thermoplastic sheath wire (such as nm, nmw etc.) should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose. many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts, including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces. the reason for this is that if there's a fire, the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building. teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas. canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us, except that canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in celsius. eg: ""ac90"" versus ""ac"". in the us, nm-b is 90 degrees celcius. note: local codes vary. this is one of the items that changes most often. eg: chicago codes require conduit *everywhere*. there are very different requirements for mobile homes. check your local codes, *especially* if you're doing anything that's the slightest out of the ordinary. wire selection table (incomplete - the real tables are enormous, uncommon wire types or applications omitted) condition type cec nec exposed/concealed dry plastic nmd90 nm armor ac90 ac teck90 exposed/concealed damp plastic nmd90 nmc armor acwu90 teck90 exposed/concealed wet plastic nmwu90 armor acwu90 teck90 exposed to weather plastic nmwu tw etc. armor teck90 direct earth burial/ plastic nmwu* uf service entrance rwu twu armor ra90 teck90 acwu90 [* nmwu not for service entrance] subject: should i use plastic or metal boxes? the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non-metallic cable only. the reasoning is simple -- with armored cable, the box itself provides ground conductor continuity. u.s. plastic boxes don't use metal cable clamps. the cec is slightly different. the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor. however, you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath. the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes. the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non-metallic sheathed cable -- you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less. on the other hand, plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts. for exposed or shop wiring, metal boxes are probably better. subject: junction box positioning? a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together. junction boxes must be located in such a way that they're accessible later. ie: not buried under plaster. excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation, and inspectors may get nasty. subject: can i install a replacement light fixture? in general, one can replace fixtures freely, subject to a few caveats. first, of course, one should check the amperage rating of the circuit. if your heart is set on installing half a dozen 500 watt floodlights, you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box. but there are some more subtle constraints as well. for example, older house wiring doesn't have high-temperature insulation. the excess heat generated by a ceiling-mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack, with obvious bad results. some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only. (you may find, in fact, that your ceiling wiring already has this problem, in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure.) other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures, and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan. you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose. a 2x4 across the ceiling joists makes a good support. metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists. there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as ""pot"" lamps or heat lamps. when these are installed in insulated ceilings, they can present a very substantial fire hazard. the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings, provided that the fixture is boxed in a ""coffin"" (usually 8'x16""x12"" - made by making a pair of joists 12"" high, and covering with plywood) that doesn't have any insulation. (yes, that's 8 *feet* long) nec rules are somewhat less stringent. they require at least 3"" clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation. the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement, which means that a cec-style ``coffin'' might be worthwhile. presumably, that's up to the local inspector. [the cec doesn't actually mandate the coffin per-se, this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can't get accidentally buried in insulation. ie: if you have insulation blown in later.] there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation. they are usually limited to 75 watt bulbs, and are unfortunately, somewhat more expensive than the older types. before you use them, you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses. follow the installation instructions carefully; the prescribed location for the sensor can vary. there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation. the ""coffin"" appears the only legal approach. subject: what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts? this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose. depending on the load balance, one hot wire may end up being more than 110v, and the other less than 110v, with respect to ground. this is a very hazardous situation - it can destroy your electronic equipment, possibly start fires, and in some situations electrocute you (ie: some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral). if this happens, contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem. note: a brief (< 1 second) brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same 220v with neutral circuit. a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second. in case of doubt, get help. subject: what is 3 phase power? should i use it? can i get it in my house? three phase power has three ""hot"" wires, 120 degrees out of phase with each other. these are usually used for large motors because it is more ""efficient"", provides a bit more starting torque, and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper. you're most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 110 volts between any hot and ground, and 208 volts between any two hots. the latter shows the difference between a normal 220v/110v common neutral circuit, which is 240 volts between the two hots. there are 3 phase circuits with different voltages. bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive, or impossible. if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount, it is *much* cheaper to buy a new 110v or 220v motor for it. in some cases it is possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a ""capacitor start"" unit, or use a larger motor as a (auto-)generator. these are tricky, but are a good solution if the motor is non-standard size, or too expensive or too big to replace. the taunton press book ``the small shop'' has an article on how to do this if you must. note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter. the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that. subject: is it better to run motors at 110 or 220? theoretically, it doesn't make any difference. however, there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring. all things being equal, a 220v motor will lose 4 times less power in the house wiring than a 110v motor. this also means that the startup surge loss will be less, and the motor will get to speed quicker. and in some circumstances, the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life. this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than 50 feet long. subject: what is this nonsense about 3hp on 110v 15a circuits? it is a universal physical law that 1 hp is equal to 746 watts. given heating loss, power factor and other inefficiencies, it is usually best to consider 1 hp is going to need 1000-1200 watts. a 110v 15a circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor, so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 hp. given rational efficiency factors, 1.5hp is more like it. some equipment manufacturers (sears in particular, most router manufacturers in general ;-) advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible. they are giving you a ""stall horsepower"" or similar. that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load. what they don't mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip, otherwise the motor will melt -- it's drawing far more current than it can continuously. when comparing motors, compare the continuous horsepower. this should be on the motor nameplate. if you can't find that figure, check the amperage rating, which is always present. subject: how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong? older homes frequently have two-prong receptacles instead of the more modern three. these receptacles have no safety ground, and the cabling usually has no ground wire. neither the nec or cec permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore. there are several different approaches to solving this: 1) if the wiring is done through conduit or bx, and the conduit is continuous back to the panel, you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box. nec mainly - cec frowns on this practise. 2) if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby, and it's continuous to the main house ground point, you can run a conductor to it from the third prong. 3) run a ground conductor back to the main panel. 4) easiest: install a gfci receptacle. the ground lug should not be connected to anything, but the gfci protection itself will serve instead. the gfci will also protect downstream (possibly also two prong outlets). if you do this to protect downstream outlets, the grounds must not be connected together. since it wouldn't be connected to a real ground, a wiring fault could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected to other outlets. be sure, though, that there aren't indirect ground plug connections, such as via the sheath on bx cable. the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non-conducting goop. like caulking compound. this is not permitted in the nec. subject: are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets? should the test button work? we're sure about what the nec and cec say. remember, though, that your local codes may vary. as for the test button -- there's a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button. current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance, and trips the gfci. this is a simple, passive, and reliable test, and doesn't require a real ground to work. if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button, it is very probably defective or miswired. again: if the test button doesn't work, something's broken, and potentially dangerous. the problem should be corrected immediately. the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected. we do not know why they say this. the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet, or with the formalities of ul or csa listing -- perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected. on the other hand, ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in *all* listed applications, including ungrounded outlet replacement. (one of us called leviton; their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only. the technician was surprised to see that; he agreed that the nec does not require it, and promised to investigate.) subject: how should i wire my shop? as with any other kind of wiring, you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously. the code specifies that you should stay under 80% of the nominal capacity of the circuit. for typical home shop use, this means one circuit for the major power tools, and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac. use at least 12 gauge wire -- many power tools have big motors, with a big start-up surge. if you can, use 20 amp breakers (nec), though cec requires standard 20a receptacles which means you'd have to ""replug"" all your equipment. lights should either be on a circuit of their own -- and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house -- or be on at least two separate circuits. the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm, while you're groping in the dark for the off switch. do install lots of outlets. it's easier to install them in the beginning, when you don't have to cut into an existing cable. it's useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point, so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want. but use metal boxes and plates, and maybe even metal-sheathed cable; you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong. note that some jurisdictions have a ""no horizontal wiring"" rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working. what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members. ie: stapled to studs. other possible shop circuits include heater circuits, 220v circuits for some large tools, and air compressor circuits. don't overload circuits, and don't use extension cords if you can help it, unless they're rated for high currents. (a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge. also, the insulation won't withstand as much heat, and heat dissipation is the critical issue.) if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel, you should probably install a subpanel, and derive your shop wiring from it. if you have young children, you may want to equip this panel with a cut-off switch, and possibly a lock. if you want to install individual switches to ``safe'' particular circuits, make sure you get ones rated high enough. for example, ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start-up surge generated by a table saw. buy ``horsepower-rated'' switches instead. finally, note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements; hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply. and even if you ``know'' that you'd never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower, the next owner of your house might have a different idea. note: fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring. april 1992 is one place to start. subject: underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specifications, use special wire, protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber (don't use creosoted lumber, it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead). the transition from in-house to underground wire is generally via conduit. all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose, and contain the appropriate gaskets, fittings, etc. if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water, a more serious style of water-proof box is needed. and of course, don't forget the gfcis. the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation. a hint: buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says ""buried power line"" and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed. subject: aluminum wiring during the 1970's, aluminum (instead of copper) wiring became quite popular and was extensively used. since that time, aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires, and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations. we recommend, even if you're allowed to, that do not use it for new wiring. but don't panic if your house has aluminum wiring. aluminum wiring, when properly installed, can be just as safe as copper. aluminum wiring is, however, very unforgiving of improper installation. we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems, and what you can do to make your wiring safe. the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as ""cold creep"". when aluminum wiring warms up, it expands. when it cools down, it contracts. unlike copper, when aluminum goes through a number of warm/cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time. to make the problem worse, aluminum oxidises, or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal, so the resistance of the connection goes up. which causes it to heat up and corrode/ oxidize still more. eventually the wire may start getting very hot, melt the insulation or fixture it's attached to, and possibly even cause a fire. since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 70's, we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring. we suggest that, if you're considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring, or have discovered it later, that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things: 1) fixtures (eg: outlets and switches) directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it. the device will be stamped with ""al/cu"" or ""co/alr"". the latter supersedes the former, but both are safe. these fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones. 2) wires should be properly connected (at least 3/4 way around the screw in a clockwise direction). connections should be tight. while repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse, during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection. note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable. it should be inspected. 3) ""push-in"" terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire. any connections using push-in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately. 4) there should be no signs of overheating: darkened connections, melted insulation, or ""baked"" fixtures. any such damage should be repaired. 5) connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially. current canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper. the nec requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices, with an anti-oxidant grease. the tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive - not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool. 6) any non-rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper ""pigtail"". see (5) above. 7) shows reasonable workmanship: neat wiring, properly stripped (not nicked) wire etc. if, when considering purchasing a home, an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe. if there are signs of problems in many places, we suggest you look elsewhere. if the wrong receptacles are used, you can replace them with the proper type, or use pigtails - having this professionally done can range from $3 to $10 per receptacle/switch. you can do this yourself too. subject: i'm buying a house! what should i do? congratulations. but... it's generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas. not just for wiring, but plumbing and structural as well. if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones, we believe that you can consider the wiring safe (after any minor problems are fixed). if there are signs of problems in many places, we suggest you look elsewhere. here's some hints on what to look for: obvious non-code wiring can include: - zip cord wiring, either concealed or nailed to walls - hot wiring on the identified (neutral) conductor without proper marking. - ungrounded grounding outlets (except when downstream of a gfci) - splices hanging in mid-air (other than proper knob-and-tube) - switched neutrals - unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines certain wiring practises that are actually to code (or were at one time) sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations: - switches that seem to control nothing (abandoned, perhaps not properly terminated wiring) - a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches. (except when it's *really* convenient ;-) - switches and outlets in bizarre locations - great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps - junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them - wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling - backwrapped grounding wires subject: what is this weird stuff? old style wiring in the years since edison ""invented"" electricity, several different wiring ""styles"" have come and gone. when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff. this section describes the old methods, and some of their idiosyncrasies. the oldest wiring system you're likely to encounter is called ""knob and tube"" (k&t). it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation. the wires are run along side structural members (eg: joists or studs) using ceramic stand-offs (knobs). wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes. connections were made by twisting the wire together, soldering, and wrapping with tape. since the hot and neutral were run separately, the wiring tends to be rather confusing. a neutral often runs down the centre of each room, with ""taps"" off to each fixture. the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next. in some cases k&t isn't colour-coded, so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires. you'll see k&t in homes built as late as the 40's. comments on k&t: - the people installing k&t were pretty paranoid about electricity, so the workmanship tends to be pretty good. - the wire, insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well. most k&t i've seen, for example, is in quite good condition. - no grounding. grounding is usually difficult to install. - boxes are small. receptacle replacement (particularly with gfci) can be difficult. no bushing on boxes either, so wiring changes need special attention to box entry. - sometimes the neutral isn't balanced very well between separately hot circuits, so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit. - building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain k&t. - connection to existing k&t from new circuits can be tricky. consult your inspector. - modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than k&t systems did. since k&t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn't necessary to replace it simply because it's k&t. what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading. in many cases it's perfectly reasonable to leave existing k&t alone, and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques. after k&t, they invented multi-conductor cable. the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation. it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two. this stuff was used in the 40's and 50's. again, no grounding conductor. it was installed much like modern wiring. its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles. we've seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch. bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems. this stuff is very fragile, and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare. this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible - whenever an opportunity arises, replace it. a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat-shrink tubing. after this wiring technique, the more modern romex was invented. it's almost a asphalt impregnated cloth. often a bit sticky. this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn't present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with. it does not need to be replaced - it should be considered as safe as the ""modern"" stuff - thermoplastic insulation wire. just don't abuse it too much. subject: where do i buy stuff? try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you. their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres, have better quality materials, have wider variety including the ""odd"" stuff, and have people behind the counter that know what you're talking about. cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people. they'll give you much valuable information. -- chris lewis; phone: canada 613 832-0541 psroff 3.0 info: ferret list:",69319,48,Electrical Wiring,Provide information and answers to common questions about electrical wiring,Neutral,Electrical Wiring,Provide information and answers to common questions about electrical wiring,Neutral

No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with;
it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN
left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds

I think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.

value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound. 

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.

In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the
word ""value"" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
""objective values.""

Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
Just because the word ""values"" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.

If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
the meaning of the word ""objective"" I doubt that this will ever happen.

So, back to the original question:

And objective morality is.....?

If you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will
be a good beginning.

What happens is that (I heard this discussed on ""Northern Exposure"") there  
is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the  
molecules in the concrete.  This acts as an attractant to UFOs (actually  
their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete

Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES!

Remedy:  Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.

How about someone letting me know MOTORCYCLE DETAILING TIP #19 ?

The far side of my instrument panel was scuffed when the previous owner

Both of the scuffed areas are black plastic.

Anyone any ideas.

I was waiting for this. I think your question should be rephrased. The many
verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been
shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?)
Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion
of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well
as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses
and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the
interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with
them.

I think the question is: What is extra-scientific about this?  

It has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on
where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered
legitimate hypotheses.  The point, in short, is this: hypotheses and
speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy, 
daydreams, ancient traditions, modern quackery, or anywhere else.

Indeed, CDs are bundled with it.
You usually get nine CDs with demos of applications, games, photos, etc.

I have compiled a list of these and posted it to alt.cdrom.
I will post an updated version of this list RSN.

Put up or shut up. Where is your evidence?
Show a study indicating a link between liking >>GROWN UPS<< of the same
sex and liking children. Saying that 30% of molested children are male
shows nothing since it tells you nothing of the molesters preference
in adults (if they have any at all).

I've seen this problem several times. It was always the result of the little

the solution is simple: remove the ball to reveal the two rollers.

Read it again yourself, then re-apply the admonition you gave to the
previous poster to yourself, as well.  The first clause is not a condition,
it is a reason for explicitly supporting the right WHICH EXISTS, MILITIA
OR NOT, that the people have a right to keep and bear arms.  This is
NOT a right granted by the Constitution, it is a right presumed to exist
by default.  The Constitution mentioning a right is to prevent the
government from removing that right by stating very clearly the government
shall NOT infringe (mess with, block, limit) that right.  Remember the
Constitution is a bunch of negative things - things the government CANNOT
do.  All rights, etc not epxressly given to the government go to the
states and the PEOPLE (the same people the other 9 Amendments in the
Bill of Rights talk about).

Since I am sure you will summarily reject my interpretation, I am
appending a linguistic analysis by one far more expert than myself (and
you, I suspect).  I am sure you will find his qualifications adequate.
If that isn't enough I can send you the Senate Subcommitee to the
Judiciary on the Constitution report on the same thing...  There are
some things in there that Big Brother types, like Biden, etc must have
really had to swallow hard to admit.

I think you will find that people that seriously study the Constitution
and state what it means will say the same thing.  Those who come up
with 'new improved meanings' are those who are trying to subvert the
Constitution for a given agenda.  Like Clinton and his Clinton Cripple,
Gun Control, People Control, and Control Control, and the whole nasty
mess.

Please tell us how this person is in error, won't you? (And please back it
up with some proof, since I am backing my assertion up with independent
proof, and have a BUNCH MORE I can provide...).

if you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning
of the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?

That was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los
Angeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton
Mifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.
Brocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor
journalism at the University of Southern California and the author of
""American Usage and Style: The Consensus.""

A little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's
expertise.

Roy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at
USC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for ""Editor and Publisher"", a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field.

He's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam
Webster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's
fifth book on usage, ""American Usage and Style: The Consensus,"" has been in
continuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner
of the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.

That sounds like an expert to me.

After a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent
the following letter:

""I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
English usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United
States Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.

""The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being
necessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep
and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

""The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
free State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the
right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'

""I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
stand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under
oath to support, if necessary.""

My letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,
then concluded:

""I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.
While I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.""

After several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political
subject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity):

[Copperud:] ""The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the
security of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a
clause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb
'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia.

""In reply to your numbered questions:

[Schulman:] ""(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?""

[Copperud:] ""(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people.""

[Schulman:] ""(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed'?""

[Copperud:] ""(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence
is assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.""

[Schulman:] ""(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact
necessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not
existing, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,
shall not be infringed' null and void?""

[Copperud:] ""(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.""

[Schulman:] ""(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary
to the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?""

[Copperud:] ""(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as
previously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia.""

[Schulman:] ""(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated
militia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'
'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?""

[Copperud:] ""(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
authority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military.""

[Schulman:] ""(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200
years ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.""

[Copperud:] ""To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
amendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: ""Since a
well-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'

[Schulman:] ""As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second
Amendment to the following sentence,

""A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free
State, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be
infringed.'

""My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,

""(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;
and

""(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for
example, registered voters with a high-school diploma?""

[Copperud:] ""(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure.

""(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation.""

Professor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his
cover letter: ""With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach
any conclusion.""

So now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what
many knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally
protects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all
governments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.

As I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
Soviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.

And here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States
ignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.
American citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning
arms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,
guaranteed by the Constitution.

And even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the
rest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but
means whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?

Or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution
of the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?

  I really think that this is the key point.  When I saw the incident on
Baseball Tonight Sunday, I couldn't believe how far away from the plate
Gant went.  Then he casually leaned against his bat.  I don't blame the 
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.

  The worst part of the whole incident was the Braves coming out onto the
field.  What were they going to do, attack the umpire?  The only people
who should've been out there were Cox and maybe the coaches, but NO players.
I agree with the person who posted before that Cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team.

also have this monitor.  We have had no problems.  Personally I would spend 
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a PC such as 33

3FGX vs the 4 series on a PC running windows at 1024x768.  The refresh rate 
appears ok for me, but you might feel differently.  Finally speaking of 
spending money, with the size of today's files, etc, a tape backup is 
certainly worth $200-$300.  Recently I set up a friend's PC 50Mhz and VESA

faster which I doubt warrants the extra cost.

Well, the fact of the matter is that poverty is imperfectly related to 
social and political instability, while economic inequality is much more
strongly related.  In virtually all major revolutions including
England (the Puritan revolution), France, Russia and China, the 
revolutions occurred as economies were undergoing substantial long term 
growth and poverty was declining.  What sets off revolutions is massive
inequality coupled with a perception on the part of those at the bottom

If ""poverty (were) the main engine of social instability,"" this typical
historical pattern would not hold.  In fact, revolutions would have been
far more typical before the nineteenth century than since that time.

Sorry, buddy, but some other ""blowhards"" managed to include the ""general
welfare"" in another portion of the constitution.

Article I Section 8: ""The Congress shall have the power to lay and collect
taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and GENERAL
WELFARE of the United States...""

I guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble.

But as noted above, the constitution doesn't say that, does it?

But since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in Article I, Section 8, I guess you'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions.  Right?

Nope. The criminals won't be stupid enough to use the new chip,
they'll use something secure. This technology provides only means to
intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
use it.

That is, the government has the keys. It doesn't matter much if they

Correct. It does, however, provide those Americans with the false

If the screening is not public, it cannot be trusted. Some people do
not trust DES even today, after all the examinations - only because
some parts of its design were kept secret.

So they'll use a different technology to hide their illegal
activities. So will those law-abiding citizens, who do not trust their
government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations.

In short, the new technology can:

1) Protect the law abiding citizen's privacy from the casual snooper.

It cannot:

1) Protect him from the government, if it decides to misuse its
ability to decrypt the conversations.

2) Protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
encryption scheme or to steal the keys, or to bribe the people who
handle them, etc.

3) Prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
communication.

Bullshit. The proposed technology provides a false sense of security,
encryption devices with built-in capabilities for breaking the
encryption, does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto, and
is a step to outlaw strong crypto.

Which Jews KS?

Do you mean those Jews who are God's chosen?

I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but
it is not sold by that name. Go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. Quickturn)
containing a bunch of FPGAs, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each
to be a DES search engine. Lets say 500 chips, running at 10Mhz = 5G tests/sec.
Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long?
Buy a bigger machine.

the above quote SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 controller chip}

are we talking about a SCSI-1 device (e.g. HD) on a SCSI-2 Controller
or 
are we talking about a SCSI-1 Controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a SCSI-2 controller board.

The April 1993 edition of MIX Magazine carries a story on 3DO which
includes pictures of the unit, a schematic of what's inside and some
indication from the people at 3DO as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (MIX is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

The schematic shows a central DMA Engine connecting and mediating between
two Graphics Animation processors (32 bit bus), a 32-bit RISC processor
with math co-processor, Video Decomp module, a control port, an expansion
port (where 3DO hangs its double-fast CD player), 1Mb DRAM, an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1MB VRAM to Video
Processor to TV chain parallel with a DSP to sound chain. 

They promise Red Book CD-quality audio, full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your PC via a PC expansion card.

I am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. The article, written by Philip De Lancie, does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread.  I come from the PC
TCP/IP world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer; 3DO seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen. 

Hope this helps.

Farewell, Minnesota fans.  Get stuffed, Dallas Stars.

As the North Stars fade to black, I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul are
not long without an NHL team.  It just seems ""right"" that the hotbed of
amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss of
the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the
1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).

I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf
Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.  (I got it
to spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up.)  What a
glorious season that was for the North Stars!

Subject: ""Seer"" Stephenson picks the A.L. East
Summary: The division has gone to the birds
Keywords: last chance for foolishness
Article-I.D.: pegasus.steph.733989466
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 95

Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse
finishes in last year's prediction contest.

AL East -- 1993

1.  Baltimore Orioles
Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to
this:
  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.
  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees
  -- Milwaukee was a fluke
  -- Indians aren't ready to contend
  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better
  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level""
""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matter
of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-
body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that Brady
Anderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""Glenn
Davis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado:
STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.
WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be
  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3
  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.
ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in
  caught stealing.

2. New York Yankees.
STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American
  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.
WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner 
  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far
  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to
  win a division.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.
ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.

3.  Toronto Blue Jays
STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie
  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.
  Guzman.  Alomar.
WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.
  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in
  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.
ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And
  have a losing record.

4.  Milwaukee Brewers
STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.
WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.
WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.
ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.

5.  Cleveland Indians
STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy
WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix
  Fermin.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.
ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.

6.  Boston Red Sox
STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens
WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre
  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL
ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how
  you will :->

7.  Detroit Tigers
STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker
WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.
  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.
  This year could be *very* ugly.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.
ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.

One more division to go....
